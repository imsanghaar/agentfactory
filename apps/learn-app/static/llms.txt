# Agent Factory

> The Spec-Driven Blueprint for Building and Monetizing Digital FTEs

## About

Agent Factory teaches domain experts how to build sellable AI agents using Claude Code, MCP, and agent SDKs. Transform expertise into AI employees that work 24/7.

## Key Topics

- **Digital FTE**: AI employees performing real work autonomously under human supervision
- **General Agents**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI for AI-driven development
- **Custom Agents**: OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK, Google ADK
- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol for universal tool connectivity
- **Agent Skills**: Reusable intelligence packaging in SKILL.md format
- **Spec-Driven Development**: AI-native software methodology with specs as source of truth

## Key Concepts

### What is a Digital FTE?
A Digital FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) is an AI employee that performs real work autonomously under human supervision. Unlike traditional software, Digital FTEs work 168 hours per week at a fraction of human cost.

### What is Spec-Driven Development?
Spec-Driven Development treats specifications as the source of truth. Humans write specs, AI generates code, tests, and documentation from those specs. This enables AI-native software development.

### What is an Agent Skill?
An Agent Skill is a reusable package of intelligence defined in SKILL.md format. Skills contain persona, logic, context, MCP integrations, and safety guardrails.
