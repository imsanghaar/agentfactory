# Chapter 48: Knowledge Graphs & GraphRAG

**Part 6: AI Native Software Development — Phase 3: Data & Memory**

This chapter teaches you how to build knowledge graphs and implement GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for AI agents. You'll learn when graph structures outperform vector similarity, how to model domain knowledge as graphs, and how to combine graph traversal with LLM reasoning.

## What You'll Learn

- **Knowledge Graph Fundamentals**: Nodes, edges, properties, and graph schemas
- **Graph Databases**: Neo4j and lightweight alternatives for agent applications
- **GraphRAG Architecture**: Combining graph traversal with vector retrieval
- **Entity Extraction**: Automatically building graphs from unstructured text
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Traversing relationships for complex queries
- **Hybrid RAG**: When to use graphs vs vectors vs both

## Prerequisites

- **Chapter 43**: Vector Databases & RAG (vector retrieval foundations)
- **Chapter 44**: Relational Databases for Agents (data modeling concepts)
- **Chapters 34-36**: Agent SDK fundamentals

## Key Technologies

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Neo4j** | Production graph database |
| **LangChain GraphRAG** | Graph-enhanced retrieval |
| **NetworkX** | Lightweight graph operations |
| **Entity Extraction** | Building graphs from text |

## Running Example

Extend the Task API with knowledge graph capabilities:
- Task dependencies as graph relationships
- Project hierarchies and team structures
- Multi-hop queries: "Show all tasks blocking the Q1 release"

> **Note**: This chapter is under development. Lessons will cover graph fundamentals through production GraphRAG implementation.
