# Chapter 42: Apps SDK - Building Interactive ChatGPT Apps

You've built agents that reason, plan, and execute tasks. But they live on your server—how do you get them in front of users who need them?

ChatGPT has over **800 million weekly active users**. Over **1 million businesses** use it daily, including **92% of Fortune 500 companies**. When you build a ChatGPT App using the Apps SDK, your application becomes available in the [ChatGPT App Directory](https://chatgpt.com/apps)—where users can discover it, add it to their ChatGPT, and start using it immediately. No separate website. No app store approval. No user acquisition cost.

This is the distribution opportunity the Apps SDK unlocks.

## What the Apps SDK Does

Chapter 34 taught you to build backend agents with OpenAI's Agents SDK—intelligent systems that process requests, use tools, and hand off between specialized agents. The Apps SDK creates the *visual layer* users see: interactive widgets that render rich UI directly inside ChatGPT conversations.

The distinction matters:
- **Agents SDK** creates *backends*—the intelligence behind operations
- **Apps SDK** creates *frontends*—visual interfaces users interact with

A complete ChatGPT App combines both: agents process requests while widgets display results with buttons, forms, and real-time updates. If the Agents SDK is the engine, the Apps SDK is the dashboard—and the dashboard is what 800 million users see.

This chapter bridges your MCP server knowledge (Chapters 37-38) with widget capabilities unique to the Apps SDK. You'll build on familiar patterns—FastMCP servers, tool definitions, structured responses—while adding the visual layer that transforms tools into complete applications available to the world's largest AI user base.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- **Explain the three-layer architecture**: Understand how ChatGPT UI, widget iframes, and MCP servers communicate to deliver interactive experiences
- **Build ChatGPT Apps with FastMCP**: Create MCP servers that expose tools with widget resources, using the `text/html+skybridge` MIME type for ChatGPT rendering
- **Implement widget interactivity**: Use the `window.openai` API for action buttons (`sendFollowUpMessage`), tool chaining (`callTool`), and state management
- **Design response payloads**: Separate data the model sees (`structuredContent`) from data only the widget sees (`_meta`) for efficient token usage
- **Manage state and display modes**: Persist user selections across tool invocations with `widgetState` and control layout with inline, pip, and fullscreen modes
- **Build a complete TaskManager ChatGPT App**: Apply all patterns to create a working task management application with add, complete, and delete functionality as your capstone project

## Chapter Structure: Building TaskManager Progressively

Unlike chapters that teach concepts separately, this chapter builds **one application progressively**. Each lesson adds a single feature to your TaskManager ChatGPT App:

| Lesson | What You Build | New Concept |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **L1: Architecture** | Mental model (no code) | Three-layer architecture, data flow |
| **L2: Hello Widget** | Minimal greeting widget (~50 lines) | `text/html+skybridge`, FastMCP basics, ngrok setup |
| **L3: Refresh Button** | Add "Refresh" button to widget | `sendFollowUpMessage`, API availability |
| **L4: Task List** | Display tasks from server | `structuredContent` vs `_meta` separation |
| **L5: Task Actions** | Add Complete/Delete buttons | `callTool`, `widgetAccessible` metadata |
| **L6: State & Modes** | Persist selections, fullscreen view | `widgetState`, display modes |
| **L7: React & Apps SDK UI** | Rebuild TaskManager in React | `@openai/apps-sdk-ui`, React hooks |
| **L8: Capstone** | Production-ready deployment | Security metadata, debugging, deployment |
| **Quiz** | Assessment | 50-question chapter assessment |

**The Progressive Approach**: By Lesson 8, you haven't just learned concepts—you've built a complete, production-ready TaskManager ChatGPT App using both vanilla JS and React approaches.

## Prerequisites

- **Chapter 34**: OpenAI Agents SDK (tools, handoffs, guardrails)
- **Chapters 37-38**: MCP Fundamentals and Custom MCP Servers (FastMCP, tool definitions)
- **Part 5**: Python Fundamentals (async/await, type hints, Pydantic)
- Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for widget development

## Tools Required

- Python 3.11+ with uv package manager
- FastMCP (`mcp[cli]>=1.9.2`) and uvicorn
- ngrok for tunneling local servers to HTTPS
- ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise account (Developer Mode access)

## Looking Ahead

This chapter gives you ChatGPT Apps with interactive widgets. Chapter 43 (Agent Testing & TDD) adds quality assurance patterns, and Chapter 44 (Evaluation Frameworks) helps you measure agent performance systematically.
