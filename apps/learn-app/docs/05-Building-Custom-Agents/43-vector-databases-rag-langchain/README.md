# Chapter 43: Vector Databases & RAG with LangChain

**You will build a RAG skill BEFORE you learn RAG concepts.**

This chapter follows the **Skill-First Learning Pattern**: In Lesson 0, you create a `rag-deployment` skill using tools from Chapter 3. Then you spend the chapter understanding what you built and making it better. By the end, you don't just "know RAG"—you OWN a production-ready skill that extends your Task API with semantic search.

## The Architecture

This chapter uses a clean separation of concerns:

| Layer                 | Technology         | Purpose                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ingestion**         | LangChain          | Document loading, text splitting, embeddings        |
| **Storage/Retrieval** | LangChain + Qdrant | Vector store, similarity search                     |
| **Intelligence**      | OpenAI Agents SDK  | Agent orchestration, LLM calls, conversation memory |
| **Evaluation**        | RAGAS + LangSmith  | Quality metrics, tracing                            |

**Why this split?** LangChain excels at document processing and retrieval. The Agents SDK (Chapter 34) excels at agent orchestration. Together, they give you the best of both worlds without framework lock-in.

## Every Lesson Has Skill Reflection

Each lesson ends with **"Reflect on Your Skill"**:

1. **Test**: Does your skill handle this lesson's concepts?
2. **Identify gaps**: What's missing?
3. **Improve**: Add or refine the capability

By Lesson 8, you've tested and improved your skill 8+ times.

## Prerequisites

- **Chapter 40**: FastAPI for Agents (Task API foundation)
- **Chapters 34-36**: Agent SDK chapters (agents know how to call tools)
- **Chapter 3**: skill-creator and fetching-library-docs
- **Docker**: For running Qdrant locally

## The Running Example

**Your Task API gets smarter.** In Chapter 40, you built a Task API with CRUD operations. Now you extend it:

- **Lessons 1-5**: Learn how RAG works—embeddings, Qdrant, retrieval chains
- **Lesson 6**: Add `/tasks/search/semantic` endpoint to your Task API
- **Lesson 8**: Implement advanced RAG patterns for intelligent task recommendations

The key insight: **Semantic search lets users find tasks by meaning, not just keywords**.

## What You'll Own

This skill joins your growing **Digital FTE toolkit**.

## The Mindset Shift

**Traditional**: "Teach me RAG"
**Agent Factory**: "I own a RAG skill—help me make it better"

You're not here to learn. You're here to **build assets**.
