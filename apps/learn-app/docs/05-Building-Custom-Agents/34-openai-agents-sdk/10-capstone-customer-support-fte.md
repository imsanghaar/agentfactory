# Capstone: Building a Customer Support Digital FTE

You have learned every pattern in the OpenAI Agents SDK toolkit. Now you prove mastery by building something you could sell.

Customer support is a $15+ billion market where businesses spend 60-70% of their support budget on labor. A Digital FTE that handles Tier 1 support---FAQs, billing questions, basic troubleshooting---at $500-2,000/month versus $4,000-8,000/month for a human representative represents genuine value.

This capstone is different from a tutorial. There's no step-by-step code to copy. Instead, you'll receive:
- **Architecture** to guide your design
- **Requirements** to specify what you must build
- **Lesson references** pointing back to the patterns you learned
- **Validation checklist** to verify your implementation
- **Business strategy** to monetize your creation

By the end, you'll have a production-ready Customer Support Digital FTE that demonstrates mastery of this chapter.

## System Architecture

Your Digital FTE follows this architecture:

## Monetization Models

Building the agent is half the journey. The other half is turning it into a business.

### Model 1: Subscription (Managed Service)

| Tier | Monthly Price | Included | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Starter | $500/month | 1,000 conversations | Small businesses |
| Growth | $1,500/month | 5,000 conversations | Growing teams |
| Enterprise | $3,000+/month | Unlimited + SLA | Large organizations |

**Margin calculation** (Growth tier):
- Revenue: $1,500/month
- Token costs: ~$300/month (5K conversations × ~$0.06 each)
- Infrastructure: ~$100/month
- **Gross margin: ~73%**

### Model 2: Success Fee (Per Resolution)

| Metric | Price | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Per conversation | $0.50-2.00 | Volume-based |
| Per resolution | $2.00-5.00 | Value-based |
| Per escalation avoided | $5.00-15.00 | Cost savings |

**Advantage:** Aligns incentives. You only get paid when the Digital FTE delivers value.

### Model 3: Hybrid (Base + Success)

| Component | Price |
|-----------|-------|
| Base platform fee | $200/month |
| Per conversation | $0.25 |
| Per escalation avoided | $3.00 |

**Why hybrid works:** Predictable base revenue with upside for performance.

### Pricing Calculator

Calculate your minimum viable price:

```
Monthly conversations: [X]
Avg tokens per conversation: ~2,000
Input token cost: (X × 1,200 × $2.50/M) = $A
Output token cost: (X × 800 × $10.00/M) = $B
Infrastructure: $50 + (X × $0.01) = $C

Total cost = $A + $B + $C
Required revenue (65% margin) = Total cost ÷ 0.35
Per conversation price = Required revenue ÷ X
```

**Example at 5,000 conversations:**
- Token cost: $275
- Infrastructure: $100
- Total: $375
- Required revenue: ~$1,070
- Per conversation: ~$0.21

## What's Next: Distribution and Deployment

Your Digital FTE is built. Now you need customers and infrastructure:

| Next Step | Chapter | What You'll Learn |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Distribution** | Ch42: OpenAI Apps SDK | Package your agent for ChatGPT's 800M+ users |
| **Containerization** | Ch49: Docker | Package your agent as a deployable container |
| **Orchestration** | Ch50: Kubernetes | Scale to handle thousands of concurrent users |
| **Monitoring** | Ch51: Helm Charts | Production monitoring and auto-scaling |

The BUILD phase is complete. The DISTRIBUTE and DEPLOY phases transform your working prototype into a business.

## Progressive Project: Complete Your Support Desk

You've built the Support Desk progressively through 9 lessons:

| Lesson | Capability Added | Key Pattern |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| L01 | Basic agent | `Agent()`, `Runner.run()` |
| L02 | Function tools | `@function_tool`, `RunContextWrapper` |
| L03 | Sub-agents | `.as_tool()` pattern |
| L04 | Handoffs | `handoff()`, routing, callbacks |
| L05 | Guardrails | `@input_guardrail`, `@output_guardrail` |
| L06 | Sessions | `SQLiteSession`, persistence |
| L07 | Tracing | `RunHooks`, `trace()`, metrics |
| L08 | MCP | `MCPServerStreamableHttp`, live docs |
| L09 | RAG | `FileSearchTool`, knowledge base |

### Your Task

**Integrate all 9 versions into a single production system.**

You already have the code. The capstone proves you understand how the pieces fit together.

**Step 1: Gather your components**

Open each version (v1.0-v9.0) of your Support Desk. Identify the imports, classes, and functions you'll need.

**Step 2: Design the integration**

Sketch how components connect:
- Which agents need which tools?
- Where do guardrails attach?
- How does session data flow?
- What gets traced?

**Step 3: Build incrementally**

Don't try to integrate everything at once:

1. First: Triage → Specialists (no guardrails, no sessions)
2. Then: Add guardrails
3. Then: Add sessions
4. Then: Add observability
5. Finally: Add MCP and RAG (if time permits)

**Step 4: Test each integration**

After each step, run a test conversation. Fix issues before adding more complexity.

**Step 5: Run the validation scenario**

Use the demo scenario in the [Validation Checklist](#validation-checklist) to verify your complete system.

---

### Applying to Your Domain

Once your Support Desk works, adapt these patterns to **your domain**:

| Domain | Specialists | Key Guardrails |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Legal | Intake, Research, Document Review | Attorney-client privilege |
| Healthcare | Triage, Scheduling, Billing, Clinical | HIPAA, PHI detection |
| Finance | Account Services, Trading, Compliance | PII, investment disclaimers |
| Education | Admissions, Registration, Financial Aid | FERPA, student records |

**Domain Adaptation Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify distinct workflows → specialist agents
- [ ] Map client language → routing rules
- [ ] Research compliance requirements
- [ ] Design domain-specific guardrails
- [ ] Calculate pricing (human cost vs. your value)

---

## Try With AI

Use your AI companion to refine your implementation.

### Prompt 1: Architecture Review

```
Review my Customer Support Digital FTE implementation:

[Paste your code]

Evaluate:
1. Are agent responsibilities clearly separated?
2. Are handoff conditions non-overlapping?
3. What edge cases might cause routing failures?
4. How would you improve error handling?
```

**What you're learning:** Critical analysis of multi-agent systems.

### Prompt 2: Compliance Enhancement

```
I'm deploying my Support Digital FTE to handle [INDUSTRY] clients.

Help me:
1. Identify compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, SOC2)
2. Design additional guardrails for compliance
3. Implement audit logging for compliance evidence
4. Create data retention policies
```

**What you're learning:** Compliance-first design for regulated industries.

### Prompt 3: Monetization Strategy

```
I've built a [DOMAIN] Digital FTE that handles [USE CASE].

Help me develop:
1. Ideal customer profile (size, pain points)
2. Pricing model (subscription, usage, hybrid)
3. Value calculation vs. human agent
4. ROI metrics for sales conversations
5. Common objections and responses
```

**What you're learning:** Business model development for AI products.

---

## Safety Note

Production deployment requires careful consideration:

- **Legal review**: Have counsel review guardrails and disclaimers
- **Data handling**: Ensure session storage complies with GDPR, CCPA
- **Liability**: Clarify what happens when the agent gives incorrect information
- **Human escalation**: Always provide a path to human support
- **Monitoring**: Alert on guardrail triggers and unusual patterns
- **Load testing**: Agents behave differently under pressure
- **Rollback plan**: Have a way to disable the Digital FTE if issues arise
