# MCP Integration: External Tools and Services

Your Customer Support Digital FTE needs to answer technical questions about your product's API. Yesterday, a user asked about rate limits. The agent gave outdated information from its training data---your API changed three months ago. Without access to current documentation, the agent can't give accurate answers.

This is the reality of LLM-based agents: their knowledge has a cutoff date. But your Digital FTE needs to provide accurate, up-to-date information to be useful. The solution isn't retraining---it's connecting your agent to live data sources through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

In previous lessons, you built agents with function tools that you defined in code. MCP inverts this: instead of defining tools yourself, your agent discovers tools from external servers at runtime. A documentation server exposes `get-library-docs`. A database server exposes `query-customers`. Your agent gains capabilities without code changes.

By the end of this lesson, you'll connect your TaskManager Digital FTE to an MCP server for live documentation lookup, understand the lifecycle management patterns for production deployments, and create a reusable skill that captures these integration patterns for future projects.

## Why MCP Changes the Agent Paradigm

Consider what happens without MCP versus with it:

| Scenario | Without MCP | With MCP |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| New API docs needed | Deploy new agent version | Agent fetches from docs server |
| Add database access | Write tool function, redeploy | Connect to database MCP server |
| Third-party integration | Build custom adapter | Use existing MCP server |
| Multiple data sources | Code each integration | Configure server list |

MCP transforms agents from static tool users to dynamic capability consumers. The agent doesn't need to know how to fetch documentation---it just needs to know that a documentation server exists.

### The MCP Architecture

MCP follows a client-server model:

```
┌─────────────────┐     HTTP/SSE      ┌─────────────────┐
│   Your Agent    │◄─────────────────►│   MCP Server    │
│  (MCP Client)   │                   │  (Tool Host)    │
└─────────────────┘                   └─────────────────┘
        │                                     │
        │  1. Connect & discover tools        │
        │  2. Agent decides to use tool       │
        │  3. Tool execution request          │
        │  4. Tool returns result             │
        │  5. Agent incorporates result       │
        ▼                                     ▼
   LLM reasoning                        External systems
   with tool results                    (APIs, databases)
```

Your agent connects to one or more MCP servers. Each server exposes tools the agent can discover and use. The agent doesn't need to know the implementation details---just the tool names, descriptions, and parameters.

## MCP Server Types

The OpenAI Agents SDK supports three types of MCP servers:

| Server Type | Transport | Use Case |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `MCPServerStdio` | Standard I/O | Local subprocess servers |
| `MCPServerStreamableHttp` | HTTP (Streamable) | Remote HTTP servers |
| `MCPServerSse` | Server-Sent Events | Legacy SSE servers |

All three require the `async with` context manager pattern for proper lifecycle management.

## Configuring MCPServerStreamableHttp

For remote MCP servers, use `MCPServerStreamableHttp` with the `params` dictionary:

```python
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
    name="docs-server",
    params={
        "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
        "timeout": 30,
    },
) as server:
    # Server is connected and ready to use
    print(f"Connected to {server.name}")
```

**Output:**

```
Connected to docs-server
```

### Server Configuration Parameters

The `params` dictionary accepts these options:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `url` | str | Required. MCP server endpoint URL |
| `headers` | dict | Optional. Custom HTTP headers for authentication |
| `timeout` | int | Optional. Connection timeout in seconds |

Additional constructor options:

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | str | Server identifier (appears in logs) | Required |
| `cache_tools_list` | bool | Cache tool definitions to avoid repeated fetches | False |
| `max_retry_attempts` | int | Number of retry attempts on failure | 0 |

### Authenticated Server Configuration

For servers requiring authentication:

```python
import os
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

token = os.environ.get("MCP_API_KEY")

async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
    name="private-docs",
    params={
        "url": "https://internal.company.com/mcp",
        "headers": {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
        "timeout": 10,
    },
    cache_tools_list=True,
    max_retry_attempts=3,
) as server:
    # Authenticated server ready
    pass
```

## Connecting Agents to MCP Servers

The agent must be created **inside** the `async with` block, and the server is passed to `mcp_servers`:

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

async def main():
    async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
        name="context7",
        params={
            "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
        },
    ) as server:
        # Create agent INSIDE the async with block
        agent = Agent(
            name="DocHelper",
            instructions="""You help developers with library documentation.
            Use the available MCP tools to look up accurate, current documentation.
            Always cite the source when providing documentation.""",
            mcp_servers=[server],
        )

        result = await Runner.run(
            agent,
            "What tools do you have available?"
        )
        print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output:**

```
I have access to tools from the context7 MCP server, including:

1. **resolve-library-id** - Find the library ID for a given library name
2. **get-library-docs** - Fetch documentation for a specific library

These tools let me look up current documentation for libraries like React, FastAPI, Pydantic, and many others. What library would you like documentation for?
```

The agent automatically discovered the tools exposed by the MCP server. You didn't need to define `@function_tool` decorators---MCP handles tool exposure.

## The Async Context Manager Pattern

MCP servers must be properly started and stopped. The `async with` pattern ensures clean lifecycle management:

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

async def run_with_mcp():
    # Server connects when entering context
    async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
        name="docs",
        params={
            "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
        },
    ) as server:
        # Agent created inside context
        agent = Agent(
            name="Helper",
            instructions="Use MCP tools to help users.",
            mcp_servers=[server],
        )

        # Run multiple queries while server is connected
        result1 = await Runner.run(agent, "Look up React hooks")
        print(f"Query 1: {result1.final_output[:100]}...")

        result2 = await Runner.run(agent, "Now look up useState specifically")
        print(f"Query 2: {result2.final_output[:100]}...")

    # Server disconnects cleanly when exiting context
    print("MCP server disconnected")

asyncio.run(run_with_mcp())
```

**Output:**

```
Query 1: React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in function componen...
Query 2: The useState hook is a function that lets you add state to functional components. It returns...
MCP server disconnected
```

### Why Context Managers Matter

Without proper lifecycle management:

| Problem | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Server not started | "No tools available" error | Use `async with` |
| Connection leak | Memory/connection exhaustion | Context manager cleanup |
| Timeout on exit | Hanging process | Proper shutdown sequence |

The context manager pattern handles:
1. **Startup**: Establishes connection, discovers available tools
2. **Execution**: Maintains connection for tool calls
3. **Shutdown**: Closes connection, releases resources

## Using MCPServerStdio for Local Servers

For local MCP servers running as subprocesses, use `MCPServerStdio`:

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio

async def run_local_mcp():
    async with MCPServerStdio(
        name="local-filesystem",
        params={
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/dir"],
        },
    ) as server:
        agent = Agent(
            name="FileHelper",
            instructions="Help users manage files using the filesystem tools.",
            mcp_servers=[server],
        )

        result = await Runner.run(agent, "List files in the current directory")
        print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(run_local_mcp())
```

The `params` dictionary for `MCPServerStdio` takes:
- `command`: The executable to run
- `args`: List of command-line arguments

## Practical Example: Documentation Lookup Agent

Let's build an agent that uses MCP to fetch library documentation. This pattern is useful for:
- Developer support Digital FTEs
- Technical writing assistants
- Code review agents that need API reference

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

async def documentation_agent():
    """Create an agent that fetches live library documentation."""

    async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
        name="context7-docs",
        params={
            "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
            "timeout": 60,  # Longer timeout for doc fetching
        },
        cache_tools_list=True,
    ) as server:
        agent = Agent(
            name="DocExpert",
            instructions="""You are a documentation expert who helps developers
            understand library APIs.

            When asked about a library:
            1. Use resolve-library-id to find the correct library identifier
            2. Use get-library-docs to fetch the documentation
            3. Summarize the relevant parts for the user's question
            4. Include code examples when available
            5. Note the documentation source for verification

            Be precise and cite specific functions, classes, or methods.""",
            mcp_servers=[server],
        )

        # Query 1: General library overview
        result = await Runner.run(
            agent,
            "How do I create a basic FastAPI application with a health check endpoint?"
        )
        print("=== FastAPI Documentation ===")
        print(result.final_output)
        print()

        # Query 2: Specific API question
        result = await Runner.run(
            agent,
            "What parameters does the FastAPI route decorator accept?"
        )
        print("=== Route Decorator Details ===")
        print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(documentation_agent())
```

**Output:**

```
=== FastAPI Documentation ===
Based on the FastAPI documentation, here's how to create a basic application with a health check:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy"}

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

To run this application:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The health check endpoint at `/health` returns a JSON response indicating the service status. This is a common pattern for Kubernetes liveness probes and load balancer health checks.

Source: FastAPI official documentation via Context7

=== Route Decorator Details ===
The FastAPI route decorator (`@app.get()`, `@app.post()`, etc.) accepts these parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `path` | str | URL path for the endpoint |
| `response_model` | Type | Pydantic model for response validation |
| `status_code` | int | HTTP status code (default 200) |
| `tags` | List[str] | OpenAPI tags for grouping |
| `summary` | str | Short endpoint description |
| `description` | str | Detailed endpoint description |
| `deprecated` | bool | Mark endpoint as deprecated |
| `response_class` | Type | Custom response class |

Example with parameters:
```python
@app.get(
    "/items/{item_id}",
    response_model=Item,
    status_code=200,
    tags=["items"],
    summary="Get an item by ID"
)
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    return {"item_id": item_id}
```

Source: FastAPI official documentation via Context7
```

The agent fetched live documentation rather than relying on potentially outdated training data.

## TaskManager with Documentation Lookup

Let's enhance our TaskManager Digital FTE with MCP integration. When users ask about task management patterns, the agent can fetch relevant documentation:

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool, RunContextWrapper
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class TaskContext(BaseModel):
    """Context for task management."""
    tasks: List[dict] = []
    user_id: str = "default"

@function_tool
def add_task(ctx: RunContextWrapper[TaskContext], description: str, priority: str = "medium") -> str:
    """Add a new task to the list.

    Args:
        description: Task description
        priority: Task priority (low, medium, high)

    Returns:
        Confirmation message
    """
    task = {
        "id": len(ctx.context.tasks) + 1,
        "description": description,
        "priority": priority,
        "done": False
    }
    ctx.context.tasks.append(task)
    return f"Added task #{task['id']}: {description} (priority: {priority})"

@function_tool
def list_tasks(ctx: RunContextWrapper[TaskContext]) -> str:
    """List all tasks with their status.

    Returns:
        Formatted task list
    """
    if not ctx.context.tasks:
        return "No tasks yet."

    lines = []
    for task in ctx.context.tasks:
        status = "done" if task["done"] else "pending"
        lines.append(f"#{task['id']} [{task['priority']}] {task['description']} - {status}")
    return "\n".join(lines)

@function_tool
def complete_task(ctx: RunContextWrapper[TaskContext], task_id: int) -> str:
    """Mark a task as complete.

    Args:
        task_id: ID of the task to complete

    Returns:
        Confirmation message
    """
    for task in ctx.context.tasks:
        if task["id"] == task_id:
            task["done"] = True
            return f"Completed task #{task_id}: {task['description']}"
    return f"Task #{task_id} not found"

async def enhanced_task_manager():
    """TaskManager with documentation lookup capabilities."""

    context = TaskContext(user_id="alice")

    async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
        name="docs",
        params={
            "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
        },
    ) as server:
        agent = Agent[TaskContext](
            name="TaskManager",
            instructions="""You are a task management assistant with two capabilities:

            1. TASK MANAGEMENT: Use add_task, list_tasks, and complete_task to manage
               the user's task list.

            2. DOCUMENTATION LOOKUP: When users ask about productivity methodologies,
               project management patterns, or programming concepts, use the MCP tools
               to fetch relevant documentation.

            Combine both capabilities when helpful. For example, if a user asks about
            implementing a Kanban workflow, you can explain the concept (via docs) and
            help them create appropriate tasks.

            Be concise but thorough. Always confirm actions taken.""",
            tools=[add_task, list_tasks, complete_task],
            mcp_servers=[server],
        )

        # Interaction 1: Task management
        result = await Runner.run(
            agent,
            "Add a task: Review pull request for user authentication",
            context=context
        )
        print(f"Alice: Add a task\nTaskManager: {result.final_output}\n")

        # Interaction 2: Documentation lookup
        result = await Runner.run(
            agent,
            "I'm implementing JWT authentication. What does the PyJWT library documentation say about token expiration?",
            context=context
        )
        print(f"Alice: JWT question\nTaskManager: {result.final_output}\n")

        # Interaction 3: Combined capability
        result = await Runner.run(
            agent,
            "Based on that JWT info, add a task to implement token refresh logic",
            context=context
        )
        print(f"Alice: Add JWT task\nTaskManager: {result.final_output}\n")

        # Interaction 4: List current tasks
        result = await Runner.run(
            agent,
            "What tasks do I have now?",
            context=context
        )
        print(f"Alice: List tasks\nTaskManager: {result.final_output}")

asyncio.run(enhanced_task_manager())
```

**Output:**

```
Alice: Add a task
TaskManager: Added task #1: Review pull request for user authentication (priority: medium)

Alice: JWT question
TaskManager: Based on the PyJWT documentation, here's how token expiration works:

JWT tokens include an `exp` (expiration) claim. When creating a token:

```python
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

payload = {
    "user_id": 123,
    "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)
}
token = jwt.encode(payload, "secret", algorithm="HS256")
```

When decoding, PyJWT automatically validates expiration:
```python
try:
    decoded = jwt.decode(token, "secret", algorithms=["HS256"])
except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
    print("Token has expired")
```

Key points:
- `exp` must be a UTC datetime or Unix timestamp
- Expired tokens raise `ExpiredSignatureError`
- Use `options={"verify_exp": False}` to skip validation (not recommended for production)

Source: PyJWT documentation via Context7

Alice: Add JWT task
TaskManager: Added task #2: Implement token refresh logic (priority: medium)

This task aligns with JWT best practices - refresh tokens allow users to get new access tokens without re-authenticating, improving both security (shorter access token lifetime) and user experience.

Alice: List tasks
TaskManager: Here are your current tasks:

#1 [medium] Review pull request for user authentication - pending
#2 [medium] Implement token refresh logic - pending
```

The agent seamlessly combines local task management with MCP-powered documentation lookup.

## Managing Multiple MCP Servers

When connecting to multiple servers, nest the `async with` statements or use `AsyncExitStack`:

```python
import asyncio
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

async def multi_server_agent():
    """Agent with multiple MCP server connections."""

    async with AsyncExitStack() as stack:
        # Connect to multiple servers
        docs_server = await stack.enter_async_context(
            MCPServerStreamableHttp(
                name="documentation",
                params={"url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"},
            )
        )

        # Hypothetical second server for database operations
        # db_server = await stack.enter_async_context(
        #     MCPServerStreamableHttp(
        #         name="database",
        #         params={"url": "https://internal.company.com/db-mcp"},
        #     )
        # )

        agent = Agent(
            name="MultiSourceAgent",
            instructions="""You have access to multiple data sources:
            1. Documentation server - for library docs
            2. Database server - for customer data (when available)

            Use the appropriate server for each query.""",
            mcp_servers=[docs_server],  # Add db_server when available
        )

        result = await Runner.run(
            agent,
            "Look up the Pydantic documentation for field validators"
        )
        print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(multi_server_agent())
```

**Output:**

```
Based on Pydantic's documentation, field validators allow custom validation logic:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str

    @field_validator('email')
    @classmethod
    def validate_email(cls, v: str) -> str:
        if '@' not in v:
            raise ValueError('Invalid email format')
        return v.lower()
```

Key points:
- Use `@field_validator('field_name')` decorator
- Validator must be a classmethod
- Return the validated/transformed value
- Raise `ValueError` for validation failures

### Error Handling for MCP Connections

MCP servers may be unavailable. Handle connection failures gracefully:

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

async def resilient_mcp_agent():
    """Agent that handles MCP server failures gracefully."""

    try:
        async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
            name="docs",
            params={
                "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
                "timeout": 10,
            },
        ) as server:
            agent = Agent(
                name="ResilientHelper",
                instructions="""You help with programming questions.

                If MCP tools are available, use them for accurate documentation.
                If tools are unavailable, rely on your training knowledge but
                note that information may be outdated.

                Always be helpful regardless of tool availability.""",
                mcp_servers=[server],
            )

            result = await Runner.run(
                agent,
                "How do I use async/await in Python?"
            )
            print(f"With MCP: {result.final_output}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"MCP connection failed: {e}")
        # Fall back to agent without MCP
        agent_fallback = Agent(
            name="ResilientHelper",
            instructions="""You help with programming questions.
            Note: Documentation lookup is currently unavailable.
            Provide helpful answers from your training knowledge."""
        )
        result = await Runner.run(
            agent_fallback,
            "How do I use async/await in Python?"
        )
        print(f"Without MCP (fallback): {result.final_output}")

asyncio.run(resilient_mcp_agent())
```

**Output:**

```
With MCP: Python's async/await syntax enables asynchronous programming:

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    # Simulated async operation
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return {"url": url, "data": "..."}

async def main():
    # Run coroutines concurrently
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        fetch_data("https://api.example.com/1"),
        fetch_data("https://api.example.com/2")
    )
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Key concepts:
- `async def` defines a coroutine function
- `await` pauses execution until the awaited coroutine completes
- `asyncio.run()` runs the main coroutine
- `asyncio.gather()` runs multiple coroutines concurrently

## Creating Your MCP Integration Skill

This is Layer 3: Intelligence Design. You've learned the MCP integration patterns---now capture them as a reusable skill.

### Skill Design: What to Capture

A good MCP integration skill should include:

| Component | What to Include |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Server Configuration** | params dictionary structure, authentication patterns |
| **Lifecycle Patterns** | async with context manager, agent creation inside context |
| **Error Handling** | Connection failures, graceful degradation |
| **Agent Instructions** | How to guide agents to use MCP tools effectively |
| **Testing Patterns** | How to verify MCP connections work |

### Skill Template

Create a skill file that captures your MCP integration patterns:

```markdown
# MCP Agent Integration Skill

## Purpose
Connect OpenAI Agents SDK agents to MCP servers for dynamic tool access.

## Server Configuration Patterns

### HTTP Server (MCPServerStreamableHttp)
```python
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
    name="server-name",
    params={
        "url": "https://mcp.example.com/mcp",
        "timeout": 30,
    },
    cache_tools_list=True,
    max_retry_attempts=3,
) as server:
    agent = Agent(
        name="Assistant",
        mcp_servers=[server],
    )
    result = await Runner.run(agent, message)
```

### Local Server (MCPServerStdio)
```python
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStdio

async with MCPServerStdio(
    name="local-server",
    params={
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["-m", "my_mcp_server"],
    },
) as server:
    agent = Agent(
        name="Assistant",
        mcp_servers=[server],
    )
    result = await Runner.run(agent, message)
```

### Authenticated Server
```python
async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
    name="private-server",
    params={
        "url": "https://internal.company.com/mcp",
        "headers": {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"},
        "timeout": 10,
    },
) as server:
    # Agent created inside context
    pass
```

## Critical Pattern: Agent Inside Context

ALWAYS create the agent INSIDE the async with block:
```python
# CORRECT
async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(...) as server:
    agent = Agent(mcp_servers=[server])
    result = await Runner.run(agent, message)

# WRONG - agent created outside context
agent = Agent(mcp_servers=[server])  # server not connected yet!
async with server:
    result = await Runner.run(agent, message)
```

## Agent Instructions Template

When creating agents with MCP access, include:
```
You have access to external tools via MCP servers.
Use these tools to fetch accurate, current information.
Always cite the source when using tool results.
If tools are unavailable, note that your response
may not reflect the latest information.
```

## Error Handling Pattern

```python
try:
    async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(...) as server:
        agent = Agent(mcp_servers=[server])
        result = await Runner.run(agent, message)
except Exception as e:
    # Fall back to non-MCP agent
    agent = Agent(instructions="MCP unavailable...")
    result = await Runner.run(agent, message)
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Server connects successfully inside async with
- [ ] Agent created inside async with block
- [ ] Agent discovers expected tools
- [ ] Tool calls return valid responses
- [ ] Graceful handling when server unavailable
```

Save this skill in your project's skill library. In future projects, you'll load this skill to quickly set up MCP integrations without re-learning the patterns.

## Progressive Project: Support Desk Assistant

Your Support Desk handles technical questions, but agents often give outdated information. "What's the return policy?" returns generic answers instead of your actual policy. In Lesson 7, you added observability. Now you'll add **MCP integration** so your agents can look up live documentation.

### What You're Building

Connect the Support Desk to an MCP server for:

| MCP Tool | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **get-library-docs** | Look up product documentation |
| **search-knowledge-base** | Search FAQs and policies |
| **get-release-notes** | Check recent product updates |

### Adding MCP Documentation Access

Now it's your turn to extend the Support Desk from Lesson 7. Using the patterns you learned above, add MCP integration for live documentation lookup.

**Step 1: Enhance your context model for documentation tracking**

Update your `SupportContext` class to track:
- Customer ID and name
- List of documents consulted (for audit trail)
- Whether MCP is available (for fallback handling)

**Step 2: Configure the MCP server inside async with**

Using the correct pattern from this lesson:

```python
async with MCPServerStreamableHttp(
    name="techcorp-docs",
    params={
        "url": "https://your-docs-server.example.com/mcp",
        "timeout": 10,
    },
) as docs_server:
    # Agent created here
    pass
```

**Step 3: Create a fallback documentation tool**

Create a `fallback_documentation` tool that provides basic cached documentation when MCP is unavailable. Include common topics like return policy, warranty, and shipping.

**Step 4: Create a documentation access logging tool**

Create a `log_doc_access` tool that records which documents were consulted and from what source (MCP or fallback).

**Step 5: Create an async function to run MCP-enabled support**

Create an async function that:
- Uses `async with` for proper lifecycle management
- Creates the agent **inside** the `async with` block with `mcp_servers=[docs_server]`
- Handles connection failures with try/except and falls back to a non-MCP agent
- Prints statistics about documents consulted

**Step 6: Update your agent instructions**

Update your support desk agent instructions to:
- Always look up documentation before answering product questions
- Use MCP tools to search the knowledge base
- Cite sources in responses
- Fall back to `fallback_documentation` when MCP is unavailable

**Step 7: Create a demo scenario**

Write a `demo_mcp_support()` async function that runs two support sessions:
1. A return policy question from Alice
2. A technical WiFi setup question from Bob

When you run your demo, you should see the agent connecting to the MCP server, discovering tools, and citing documentation sources in its responses.

### Extension Challenge

Add **multi-server MCP** for different knowledge domains using `AsyncExitStack`:

```python
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack

async def multi_source_support():
    async with AsyncExitStack() as stack:
        product_docs = await stack.enter_async_context(
            MCPServerStreamableHttp(
                name="products",
                params={"url": "..."},
            )
        )
        policy_docs = await stack.enter_async_context(
            MCPServerStreamableHttp(
                name="policies",
                params={"url": "..."},
            )
        )

        support_desk = Agent(
            name="SupportDesk",
            mcp_servers=[product_docs, policy_docs],
            # Your implementation
        )
```

### What's Next

Your Support Desk can look up live documentation, but what about your internal knowledge base? In Lesson 9, you'll add **RAG with FileSearchTool** to answer questions from your uploaded documents.

### Bonus Challenges

1. **Search aggregation**: Connect to multiple MCP servers (docs + search) and combine results
2. **Export functionality**: Add a tool to export notes as Markdown
3. **Session persistence**: Save research sessions to file for later continuation
4. **Quality scoring**: Rate source quality and prioritize high-quality documentation

## Try With AI

Use your AI companion to explore MCP integration patterns further.

### Prompt 1: Design an MCP Architecture

```
I'm building a Digital FTE that needs access to:
1. Company internal documentation (Confluence/Notion)
2. Customer database (PostgreSQL)
3. Ticket system (Jira)

Help me design the MCP architecture:
1. What MCP servers would I need?
2. How should the agent decide which server to query?
3. What security considerations apply?
4. Show me the agent configuration code using proper async with patterns.
```

**What you're learning:** Enterprise architecture for MCP integration. You're developing the system design thinking needed to connect Digital FTEs to real company data sources.

### Prompt 2: Build a Custom MCP Server

```
I want to create an MCP server that exposes my TaskManager
operations (add_task, list_tasks, complete_task) so other
agents can manage tasks remotely.

Help me:
1. Design the MCP server using FastMCP (Python)
2. Define the tool schemas for task operations
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Show how an agent would connect using MCPServerStreamableHttp with params dict
```

**What you're learning:** Building the other side of MCP integration. Understanding how to create MCP servers opens up the ability to expose any system as agent-accessible tools.

### Prompt 3: Apply MCP to Your Domain

```
I'm building a Digital FTE for [YOUR DOMAIN: legal research,
medical intake, financial analysis, etc.].

Help me identify:
1. What external data sources would benefit from MCP integration?
2. Are there existing MCP servers for my domain?
3. What custom MCP servers would I need to build?
4. How should I handle sensitive data through MCP?

Provide a complete architecture with agent configuration using
the correct async with MCPServerStreamableHttp pattern.
```

**What you're learning:** Translating MCP patterns to domain-specific needs. Every industry has unique data sources, and MCP provides a consistent way to connect agents to them.

### Safety Note

MCP servers can expose sensitive capabilities to your agents. When integrating MCP:

- **Authentication**: Always use authenticated connections for internal servers. Never expose production databases without proper auth.
- **Scope limitation**: Configure MCP servers to expose only necessary tools. A docs server shouldn't have write access to production.
- **Input validation**: MCP tools should validate all inputs. Agents may pass unexpected parameters.
- **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limits on MCP servers to prevent agent loops from overwhelming systems.
- **Audit logging**: Log all MCP tool calls for compliance and debugging. Include agent identity and parameters.
- **Network isolation**: Run MCP servers in appropriate network segments. Internal databases shouldn't be accessible from public agents.
