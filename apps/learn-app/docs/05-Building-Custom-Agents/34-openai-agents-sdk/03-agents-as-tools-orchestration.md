# Agents as Tools and Multi-Agent Orchestration

Your single-agent solutions work well for focused tasks, but real-world problems rarely fit into one agent's scope. A customer inquiry might need product information, billing details, and technical support---three different knowledge domains. A content pipeline might need research, writing, and editing---three different skill sets. How do you coordinate multiple specialized agents without losing control of the workflow?

The SDK offers two patterns for multi-agent coordination. The first---**handoffs**---transfers complete control from one agent to another. You'll learn handoffs in detail in the next lesson. But handoffs have a limitation: once control transfers, the original agent is out of the picture.

What if you need a manager who gathers information from multiple specialists, synthesizes their responses, and presents a unified answer? That's where **agents as tools** comes in---a pattern where the orchestrator stays in control while calling specialists as needed.

This lesson teaches you to build orchestrated multi-agent systems. You'll convert agents into callable tools, extract structured outputs from sub-agents, and design manager patterns that coordinate complex workflows. By the end, you'll have built a research pipeline where a manager agent calls specialized researcher and writer agents to produce comprehensive reports.

## The Orchestrator Pattern: Manager Stays in Control

Consider a content manager who needs to:
1. Ask a researcher to gather facts
2. Ask a writer to draft content based on those facts
3. Ask a reviewer to check quality
4. Synthesize all feedback into a final piece

The manager needs to stay in control, receiving outputs from each specialist and making decisions about what to do next. This is the **orchestrator pattern**---and it requires treating agents as tools rather than handoff destinations.

## Converting Agents to Tools with as_tool()

The SDK provides `agent.as_tool()` to convert any agent into a callable tool. The orchestrator can then invoke that agent like any other function:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Specialist agent for research
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="""You are a research specialist.
    When given a topic, provide 3-5 key facts with sources.
    Be concise and factual."""
)

# Specialist agent for writing
writer_agent = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="""You are a content writer.
    When given facts, transform them into engaging prose.
    Use clear, accessible language."""
)

# Manager agent that orchestrates specialists
manager = Agent(
    name="Content Manager",
    instructions="""You coordinate content creation.
    For any content request:
    1. Use do_research to gather facts on the topic
    2. Use write_content to transform facts into prose
    3. Present the final content to the user""",
    tools=[
        research_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="do_research",
            tool_description="Research a topic and return key facts"
        ),
        writer_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="write_content",
            tool_description="Transform facts into engaging content"
        )
    ]
)

# Run the orchestrated workflow
result = Runner.run_sync(
    manager,
    "Create a brief overview of renewable energy trends in 2025"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Output:**
```
# Renewable Energy Trends in 2025

The renewable energy landscape is transforming rapidly. Solar power costs
have dropped 89% since 2010, making it the cheapest electricity source in
history. Wind energy now provides 10% of global electricity, up from 4%
a decade ago.

Battery storage capacity has tripled in the past three years, solving
renewables' intermittency challenge. Major automakers have committed to
100% electric vehicle production by 2030, driving additional grid demand.

Investment in clean energy reached $1.7 trillion in 2024, surpassing
fossil fuel investment for the first time. This trend is expected to
accelerate as countries pursue net-zero commitments.
```

The manager agent called `do_research` first, received facts from the researcher, then called `write_content` with those facts, and finally presented the writer's output. Throughout this process, the manager stayed in control, deciding when to call each specialist.

## Understanding as_tool() Parameters

The `as_tool()` method accepts several parameters that control how the agent appears to the orchestrator:

```python
research_tool = research_agent.as_tool(
    tool_name="do_research",           # How the orchestrator calls this tool
    tool_description="Research a topic and return key facts",  # Helps orchestrator decide when to use it
    custom_output_extractor=None       # Transform the agent's output (covered next)
)

print(f"Tool name: {research_tool.name}")
print(f"Description: {research_tool.description[:50]}...")
```

**Output:**
```
Tool name: do_research
Description: Research a topic and return key facts...
```

| Parameter | Purpose | Default |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `tool_name` | Identifier for the tool in orchestrator's toolkit | Agent's name |
| `tool_description` | Explains when and how to use this tool | Agent's instructions (truncated) |
| `custom_output_extractor` | Function to transform agent output | Returns `final_output` as-is |

Good tool names are action-oriented: `do_research`, `write_content`, `review_quality`. They tell the orchestrator what the tool does, not what it is.

Good descriptions are specific: "Research a topic and return 3-5 key facts with sources" rather than "Does research." The orchestrator uses this description to decide when to invoke the tool.

## Custom Output Extractors for Structured Data

Sub-agents return natural language by default, but orchestrators often need structured data. A `custom_output_extractor` transforms the agent's output into a format the orchestrator can use programmatically:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class ResearchFindings(BaseModel):
    topic: str
    facts: List[str]
    sources: List[str]
    confidence: float

# Research agent with structured output
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="""You are a research specialist.
    When given a topic, provide key facts with sources.
    Always include a confidence score (0-1) for your findings.""",
    output_type=ResearchFindings  # Structured output from this agent
)

def extract_research(result):
    """Extract structured findings from research agent."""
    # result.final_output is already a ResearchFindings object
    # because we set output_type on the agent
    findings = result.final_output
    return f"TOPIC: {findings.topic}\nFACTS: {'; '.join(findings.facts)}\nCONFIDENCE: {findings.confidence}"

manager = Agent(
    name="Content Manager",
    instructions="""You coordinate content creation.
    The research tool returns structured findings with topic, facts, and confidence.
    Only proceed to writing if confidence > 0.7.""",
    tools=[
        research_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="do_research",
            tool_description="Research a topic. Returns structured findings with confidence score.",
            custom_output_extractor=extract_research
        ),
        writer_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="write_content",
            tool_description="Transform research into prose"
        )
    ]
)
```

The output extractor receives the complete `RunResult` from the sub-agent, giving you access to:

```python
def detailed_extractor(result):
    """Access full result details."""
    output = result.final_output     # Agent's response
    agent = result.last_agent        # Which agent produced this
    items = result.new_items         # All messages generated

    # Transform as needed for orchestrator
    return f"[{agent.name}] {output}"

# Example of what the extractor receives and returns
# (When used, it transforms: "Here are the facts..." -> "[Researcher] Here are the facts...")
```

**Output:**
```
[Researcher] Here are 5 key facts about renewable energy: 1. Solar costs dropped 89%...
```

## The Orchestrator Pattern in Depth

The orchestrator pattern has three components:

1. **Specialist agents**: Focused experts with narrow responsibilities
2. **Manager agent**: Coordinates specialists, makes decisions, synthesizes results
3. **Tool bindings**: Connect specialists to manager via `as_tool()`

Let's build a complete content pipeline with three specialists:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

# Pydantic models for structured communication
class ResearchOutput(BaseModel):
    topic: str
    facts: List[str]
    gaps: List[str]  # What we couldn't find

class ContentDraft(BaseModel):
    title: str
    body: str
    word_count: int

class ReviewFeedback(BaseModel):
    approved: bool
    issues: List[str]
    suggestions: List[str]

# Specialist 1: Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="""You research topics thoroughly.
    Return structured findings including facts discovered
    and gaps in available information.
    Be honest about uncertainty.""",
    output_type=ResearchOutput
)

# Specialist 2: Writer
writer = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="""You write engaging content from research.
    Return structured drafts with title, body, and word count.
    Aim for clarity and flow.""",
    output_type=ContentDraft
)

# Specialist 3: Reviewer
reviewer = Agent(
    name="Reviewer",
    instructions="""You review content for accuracy and quality.
    Return structured feedback: approved/rejected, issues found,
    and suggestions for improvement.""",
    output_type=ReviewFeedback
)

# Output extractors for each specialist
def extract_research(result):
    r = result.final_output
    return f"FACTS:\n" + "\n".join(f"- {f}" for f in r.facts) + \
           f"\n\nGAPS: {', '.join(r.gaps) if r.gaps else 'None'}"

def extract_draft(result):
    d = result.final_output
    return f"TITLE: {d.title}\n\nCONTENT ({d.word_count} words):\n{d.body}"

def extract_review(result):
    r = result.final_output
    status = "APPROVED" if r.approved else "NEEDS REVISION"
    return f"STATUS: {status}\nISSUES: {', '.join(r.issues) if r.issues else 'None'}\n" + \
           f"SUGGESTIONS: {', '.join(r.suggestions) if r.suggestions else 'None'}"

# Manager that orchestrates the pipeline
content_manager = Agent(
    name="Content Pipeline Manager",
    instructions="""You manage a content creation pipeline.

    For each content request:
    1. Call research_topic to gather facts
    2. If research has gaps, acknowledge them in final content
    3. Call create_draft to write content from facts
    4. Call review_draft to check quality
    5. If not approved, summarize issues for the user
    6. If approved, present the final content

    Always explain your decisions at each step.""",
    tools=[
        researcher.as_tool(
            tool_name="research_topic",
            tool_description="Research a topic. Returns facts and information gaps.",
            custom_output_extractor=extract_research
        ),
        writer.as_tool(
            tool_name="create_draft",
            tool_description="Write content from research facts. Returns titled draft with word count.",
            custom_output_extractor=extract_draft
        ),
        reviewer.as_tool(
            tool_name="review_draft",
            tool_description="Review content quality. Returns approval status and feedback.",
            custom_output_extractor=extract_review
        )
    ]
)

# Execute the pipeline
result = Runner.run_sync(
    content_manager,
    "Create a 200-word overview of quantum computing applications"
)
print(result.final_output)
```

**Output:**
```
I've completed the content pipeline for your quantum computing overview.

**Research Phase**: I gathered facts on quantum computing applications including
cryptography, drug discovery, financial modeling, and climate simulation.
No significant gaps were found.

**Writing Phase**: Created a draft titled "Quantum Computing: Transforming
Industries" at 215 words.

**Review Phase**: The content was APPROVED with one suggestion to add a
specific company example, which I've incorporated.

# Quantum Computing: Transforming Industries

Quantum computing is revolutionizing how we solve complex problems...
[Full content would appear here]

---

The content is ready for use. Would you like me to adjust the length or focus
on any specific application area?
```

The manager maintained control throughout, making decisions based on each specialist's output. This is the core value of the orchestrator pattern: **centralized decision-making with distributed expertise**.

## Dynamic Agent Composition with clone()

Sometimes you need agent variants---the same specialist configured differently for different contexts. The `clone()` method creates a copy with selective modifications:

```python
# Base researcher agent
base_researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="You research topics and return key findings."
)

# Variant for academic research (adds citation tool)
@function_tool
def search_academic_papers(query: str) -> str:
    """Search academic databases for papers."""
    return f"Found 5 papers on: {query}..."

academic_researcher = base_researcher.clone(
    tools=[search_academic_papers],
    instructions=base_researcher.instructions + "\nAlways cite academic sources."
)

# Variant for news research (adds news API tool)
@function_tool
def search_news(query: str, days: int = 7) -> str:
    """Search recent news articles."""
    return f"Found 10 articles from past {days} days on: {query}..."

news_researcher = base_researcher.clone(
    tools=[search_news],
    instructions=base_researcher.instructions + "\nFocus on recent developments."
)

# Verify the clones have different configurations
print(f"Academic tools: {[t.name for t in academic_researcher.tools]}")
print(f"News tools: {[t.name for t in news_researcher.tools]}")
```

**Output:**
```
Academic tools: ['search_academic_papers']
News tools: ['search_news']
```

```python
# Manager can use different researchers for different needs
content_manager = Agent(
    name="Content Manager",
    instructions="""You create content using appropriate research.
    Use academic_research for technical topics.
    Use news_research for current events.""",
    tools=[
        academic_researcher.as_tool(
            tool_name="academic_research",
            tool_description="Research using academic papers and citations"
        ),
        news_researcher.as_tool(
            tool_name="news_research",
            tool_description="Research recent news and developments"
        ),
        writer_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="write_content",
            tool_description="Transform research into prose"
        )
    ]
)
```

The `clone()` method accepts any Agent parameter:

```python
variant = base_agent.clone(
    name="Variant Name",           # New name
    instructions="New instructions",  # Replace instructions
    tools=[new_tool],              # Replace tools
    model="gpt-4o-mini",           # Different model
    output_type=NewOutputType      # Different output structure
)

print(f"Original: {base_agent.name}, Model: {base_agent.model}")
print(f"Variant: {variant.name}, Model: {variant.model}")
```

**Output:**
```
Original: Researcher, Model: gpt-4o
Variant: Variant Name, Model: gpt-4o-mini
```

**Use clone() when you need**:
- Same agent logic with different tools for different contexts
- Model variants (fast vs accurate) of the same specialist
- Instruction variations for different user types

## When to Use Agents as Tools

You've now mastered the orchestrator pattern. But when is it the right choice? The key question is: **does the manager need to stay in control?**

**Use agents as tools when**:
- You need to combine outputs from multiple specialists
- The orchestrator must make decisions based on intermediate results
- You want a single, synthesized response
- The workflow has predictable stages (research → write → review)

**Examples**: Research pipelines, content creation, data analysis, report generation.

In the next lesson, you'll learn **handoffs**---a different pattern where one agent transfers complete control to another. Handoffs work better when specialists need to own the entire conversation (like routing a billing question to a billing expert). After learning both patterns, you'll be able to choose the right approach for any multi-agent scenario.

## Progressive Project: Support Desk Assistant

Let's add **specialist sub-agents** to our Support Desk. Instead of handling everything in one agent, we'll delegate research and response drafting to specialists.

### Adding Specialist Sub-Agents

Now it's your turn to add sub-agents to your Support Desk. Using the patterns from this lesson, create specialists that your main agent can delegate to.

**Step 1: Design your specialists**

Think about what specialized roles would help your support desk:
- **Knowledge Researcher**: Finds technical solutions and troubleshooting steps
- **Response Writer**: Crafts professional, empathetic customer responses
- **Escalation Analyst**: Determines priority and routing for complex cases

**Step 2: Create the Knowledge Researcher agent**

Using the [Orchestrator Pattern](#the-orchestrator-pattern-manager-stays-in-control) section as reference:
```python
knowledge_researcher = Agent(
    name="KnowledgeResearcher",
    instructions="..."  # Define what this specialist does
)
```

Write instructions that tell it to:
- Provide common causes of problems
- Give step-by-step troubleshooting guides
- Format responses as structured steps

**Step 3: Create the Response Writer agent**

This specialist takes technical information and writes customer-friendly responses:
- Acknowledge customer frustration
- Explain solutions in simple terms
- Offer next steps if the solution doesn't work

**Step 4: Create the Escalation Analyst agent**

This specialist analyzes requests to determine:
- Priority level (low, normal, high, urgent)
- Which team should handle it
- Whether immediate escalation is needed

**Step 5: Convert agents to tools**

Use the `.as_tool()` method you learned in [Converting Agents to Tools](#converting-agents-to-tools-with-as_tool):
```python
knowledge_researcher.as_tool(
    tool_name="research_knowledge",
    tool_description="Research technical solutions for product issues"
)
```

Do the same for your other specialists.

**Step 6: Update your main agent as orchestrator**

Modify your Support Desk agent to use these specialist tools:
- Add all three tools to the `tools=[]` list
- Update instructions to describe the workflow:
  - Technical issues: research first, then draft response
  - Complex cases: analyze escalation first
  - Always review specialist output before responding

**Step 7: Test with a complex customer query**

Try an angry customer message that requires multiple specialists:
```
"I've been trying to sync files for 3 days and nothing works!
This is affecting my team's productivity. We pay premium for a reason!"
```

Your orchestrator should delegate to research_knowledge, then draft_response.

### Success Criteria

Your Support Desk now:
- ✅ Delegates research to a knowledge specialist
- ✅ Uses a writer for professional responses
- ✅ Analyzes complex cases for proper routing
- ✅ Coordinates multiple specialists effectively

### What's Next

Your orchestrator coordinates specialists, but what if a case needs a completely different expert? In Lesson 4, you'll add **handoffs** that transfer full conversation control to billing, technical, or sales teams.

## Try With AI

Use your AI companion to explore orchestration patterns further.

### Prompt 1: Design an Orchestration Architecture

```
I want to build a multi-agent system for [your use case: code review,
content moderation, data analysis, etc.] using the orchestrator pattern.
Help me design the architecture:

1. What specialists do I need?
2. What structured outputs should each specialist return?
3. How should the manager coordinate these specialists?
4. What decision logic should the manager implement?

Show me the Agent definitions with output_type models and as_tool
configurations.
```

**What you're learning:** System design for multi-agent architectures. You're developing the skill to decompose complex problems into specialist agents and design the coordination logic that binds them together.

### Prompt 2: Debug Orchestration Issues

```
My orchestrator isn't calling specialists in the right order. Here's
my manager agent:

[paste your manager agent code]

The manager is calling write_content before research completes.
Help me:
1. Diagnose why the ordering is wrong
2. Fix the instructions to enforce sequencing
3. Add validation to ensure research runs first
```

**What you're learning:** Debugging agent coordination problems. You're understanding how instructions and tool descriptions influence agent behavior, and how to constrain multi-step workflows.

### Prompt 3: Optimize Sub-Agent Communication

```
My orchestrator works but the output extractors are messy. Here's my
current extractor:

[paste your custom_output_extractor code]

Help me:
1. Make the extracted data more useful for the manager
2. Add error handling for missing fields
3. Create a consistent format across all extractors
```

**What you're learning:** Data transformation between agents. Clean inter-agent communication is essential for reliable orchestration, and you're developing patterns for structured information flow.

### Safety Note

Multi-agent systems multiply both capability and risk. Each agent you add is another point where things can go wrong. Always:
- Test each specialist independently before orchestration
- Implement timeouts for sub-agent calls (agents can loop indefinitely)
- Log all inter-agent communication for debugging
- Start with 2-3 agents and add complexity gradually
- Consider cost: each sub-agent call uses tokens and API calls
