# Agent Handoffs and Message Filtering

Your Customer Support Digital FTE receives a message: "I'd like a refund for order #12345." The triage agent understands the intent immediately---this is a refund request, not a FAQ or billing inquiry. But the triage agent isn't equipped to process refunds. It needs to hand off to a specialist.

This is the essence of multi-agent systems: specialized agents that excel at narrow tasks, coordinated by a triage agent that routes requests to the right specialist. The pattern mirrors how human support teams work---a receptionist takes your call and transfers you to the right department.

In the previous lesson, you learned to give agents capabilities with function tools. Now you'll give them teammates. By the end of this lesson, you'll have built a support routing system where a triage agent hands off to specialists, those specialists can hand back when they need help, and conversation context flows cleanly between agents.

## Why Handoffs Matter

Consider what happens without handoffs:

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| One mega-agent | Instructions become enormous, quality degrades |
| Separate agents | No coordination, user restarts conversation |
| Manual routing | Developer decides routing, no autonomy |

Handoffs solve this. The LLM decides when and where to route based on conversation context. Each specialist agent stays focused on its domain. The user experiences a seamless conversation.

## Understanding Handoffs

When you add `handoffs` to an agent, the SDK automatically:

1. Creates a tool for each handoff (e.g., `transfer_to_billing_agent`)
2. Includes the tool in the agent's available actions
3. Handles the transfer when the agent calls the tool
4. Passes conversation context to the receiving agent

The receiving agent then continues the conversation. From the user's perspective, it's one continuous interaction.

## Basic Handoffs: The Handoffs List

The simplest way to enable handoffs is passing agents directly to the `handoffs` parameter:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Specialist agents
billing_agent = Agent(
    name="billing_agent",
    instructions="""You handle billing questions:
    - Invoice inquiries
    - Payment methods
    - Subscription changes

    If the user needs a refund or has a technical issue, say you cannot help with that."""
)

technical_agent = Agent(
    name="technical_agent",
    instructions="""You handle technical support:
    - Bug reports
    - Feature questions
    - Integration help

    If the user has a billing question, say you cannot help with that."""
)

# Triage agent with handoffs
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="triage_agent",
    instructions="""You are the first point of contact for customer support.

    Route users to the right specialist:
    - Billing questions (invoices, payments, subscriptions) -> billing_agent
    - Technical issues (bugs, features, integrations) -> technical_agent

    If unclear, ask clarifying questions before routing.""",
    handoffs=[billing_agent, technical_agent]
)

# Run triage agent
result = Runner.run_sync(triage_agent, "My credit card was charged twice this month.")
print(f"Final agent: {result.last_agent.name}")
print(f"Response: {result.final_output}")
```

**Output:**

```
Final agent: billing_agent
Response: I understand you've been charged twice this month, which is concerning. Let me help you resolve this.

Could you provide:
1. The date(s) of the duplicate charges
2. The last 4 digits of the card that was charged
3. Your account email

I'll investigate the duplicate charge and process a refund if confirmed.
```

Notice that `result.last_agent` tells you which agent produced the final response. The triage agent recognized the billing issue and handed off to `billing_agent`.

## The handoff() Function

For more control, use the `handoff()` function instead of passing agents directly:

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff

billing_agent = Agent(name="billing_agent", instructions="Handle billing.")

# Create handoff with customizations
billing_handoff = handoff(
    agent=billing_agent,
    tool_name_override="route_to_billing",
    tool_description_override="Transfer to billing specialist for payment and invoice issues"
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="triage",
    instructions="Route to appropriate specialist.",
    handoffs=[billing_handoff]
)
```

The `handoff()` function accepts:

| Parameter | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `agent` | Target agent to hand off to |
| `tool_name_override` | Custom tool name (default: `transfer_to_{agent_name}`) |
| `tool_description_override` | Custom description for LLM context |
| `on_handoff` | Callback executed when handoff occurs |
| `input_filter` | Function to modify conversation before handoff |
| `input_type` | Pydantic model for structured handoff data |

## Handoff Callbacks with on_handoff

The `on_handoff` callback runs when a handoff is triggered---before the target agent receives the conversation. This is useful for:

- Logging handoff events
- Prefetching data the specialist will need
- Recording analytics
- Updating session state

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, handoff, RunContextWrapper
from pydantic import BaseModel

class SupportContext(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    handoff_count: int = 0

def on_billing_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper[SupportContext]):
    """Called when user is transferred to billing."""
    ctx.context.handoff_count += 1
    print(f"[HANDOFF] User {ctx.context.user_id} transferred to billing")
    print(f"[HANDOFF] Total handoffs this session: {ctx.context.handoff_count}")
    # In production: prefetch billing history, log to analytics

def on_technical_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper[SupportContext]):
    """Called when user is transferred to technical support."""
    ctx.context.handoff_count += 1
    print(f"[HANDOFF] User {ctx.context.user_id} transferred to technical")

billing_agent = Agent[SupportContext](
    name="billing_agent",
    instructions="Handle billing inquiries."
)

technical_agent = Agent[SupportContext](
    name="technical_agent",
    instructions="Handle technical support."
)

triage_agent = Agent[SupportContext](
    name="triage_agent",
    instructions="""Route users appropriately:
    - Billing questions -> billing_agent
    - Technical issues -> technical_agent""",
    handoffs=[
        handoff(billing_agent, on_handoff=on_billing_handoff),
        handoff(technical_agent, on_handoff=on_technical_handoff)
    ]
)

# Run with context
context = SupportContext(user_id="user_42")
result = Runner.run_sync(
    triage_agent,
    "I need help with an invoice discrepancy.",
    context=context
)

print(f"\nFinal response from {result.last_agent.name}:")
print(result.final_output)
```

**Output:**

```
[HANDOFF] User user_42 transferred to billing
[HANDOFF] Total handoffs this session: 1

Final response from billing_agent:
I'd be happy to help with your invoice discrepancy. To investigate this properly, I'll need:

1. Your account email or customer ID
2. The invoice number or date in question
3. What specifically looks incorrect on the invoice

Once you provide these details, I can review the charges and resolve any errors.
```

The callback executed immediately when the handoff was triggered, before the billing agent started processing.

## Input Filters: Controlling Context Flow

By default, the target agent receives the entire conversation history. Sometimes that's too much:

- Token costs increase with history length
- Irrelevant tool calls clutter context
- Previous agent's internal reasoning may confuse the specialist

Input filters let you control what context the target agent receives.

### The HandoffInputData Structure

An input filter receives `HandoffInputData` containing:

- `history`: Previous conversation items
- `pre_handoff_items`: Items from current run before handoff
- `new_items`: New items being added

Your filter returns modified `HandoffInputData`:

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff, HandoffInputData

def filter_recent_only(data: HandoffInputData) -> HandoffInputData:
    """Keep only the last 5 messages to reduce context size."""
    # Filter history to last 5 items
    recent_history = data.history[-5:] if len(data.history) > 5 else data.history

    return HandoffInputData(
        history=recent_history,
        pre_handoff_items=data.pre_handoff_items,
        new_items=data.new_items
    )

billing_agent = Agent(name="billing_agent", instructions="Handle billing.")

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="triage_agent",
    instructions="Route appropriately.",
    handoffs=[
        handoff(
            agent=billing_agent,
            input_filter=filter_recent_only
        )
    ]
)
```

Now the billing agent only sees the last 5 messages, reducing token usage and focusing context.

## Built-in Handoff Filters

The SDK provides common filters in `agents.extensions.handoff_filters`:

### remove_all_tools

This filter strips all tool-related items from conversation history:

- Function calls and their outputs
- File search results
- Web search results

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff
from agents.extensions import handoff_filters

faq_agent = Agent(
    name="faq_agent",
    instructions="Answer frequently asked questions."
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="triage_agent",
    instructions="Route to FAQ for common questions.",
    tools=[get_user_info, check_order_status],  # These tools won't clutter FAQ context
    handoffs=[
        handoff(
            agent=faq_agent,
            input_filter=handoff_filters.remove_all_tools
        )
    ]
)
```

**Output:**

When a handoff occurs, the FAQ agent sees only the conversational messages---no tool calls, no function outputs. This keeps its context clean and focused on the user's question.

### Why Filter Tools?

Consider this scenario:

1. User asks: "What's my order status?"
2. Triage agent calls `check_order_status()` tool
3. Tool returns: `{"order_id": "12345", "status": "shipped", "tracking": "1Z999..."}`
4. User asks: "Actually, I have a billing question too"
5. Triage hands off to billing agent

Without filtering, the billing agent sees all that order status data---irrelevant to billing and consuming tokens. With `remove_all_tools`, the billing agent only sees the conversation.

## Handoff Chains with Return Paths

Handoffs are **unidirectional by design**---when Agent A hands off to Agent B, control transfers completely. Agent B doesn't automatically return to Agent A when finished.

However, specialists sometimes need to escalate or transfer to another agent. You can create explicit return paths by giving specialists their own handoffs:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, handoff

# Define escalation agent first (no handoffs needed)
escalation_agent = Agent(
    name="escalation_agent",
    instructions="""You handle escalated cases that require human review.

    Document the issue thoroughly and let the user know a human will follow up within 24 hours."""
)

# Billing agent can escalate or return to triage
billing_agent = Agent(
    name="billing_agent",
    instructions="""You handle billing questions.

    If the user's issue requires:
    - Technical support (bugs, integrations) -> return to triage
    - Human review (fraud, disputes over $500) -> escalate

    Otherwise, resolve the billing issue directly.""",
    handoffs=[escalation_agent]  # Can escalate
)

# Technical agent can also escalate
technical_agent = Agent(
    name="technical_agent",
    instructions="""You handle technical issues.

    If the issue is a critical production outage or security concern -> escalate

    Otherwise, provide technical assistance.""",
    handoffs=[escalation_agent]
)

# Triage routes to specialists, specialists can return to triage
# Note: We need to create triage first, then update billing's handoffs
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="triage_agent",
    instructions="""Route users to the right specialist:
    - Billing (invoices, payments) -> billing_agent
    - Technical (bugs, features) -> technical_agent
    - Unclear -> ask clarifying questions""",
    handoffs=[billing_agent, technical_agent]
)

# Add triage to billing's handoffs for return capability
billing_agent = Agent(
    name="billing_agent",
    instructions="""You handle billing questions.

    If the user's issue is actually technical -> transfer back to triage
    If it requires human review -> escalate

    Otherwise, resolve directly.""",
    handoffs=[escalation_agent, triage_agent]  # Can escalate OR return
)

# Test the flow
context_msg = "I was charged twice and I think there's a bug in your checkout system."
result = Runner.run_sync(triage_agent, context_msg)

print(f"Final agent: {result.last_agent.name}")
print(f"Response: {result.final_output}")
```

**Output:**

```
Final agent: technical_agent
Response: I understand you're experiencing a double-charge issue during checkout. This could be a technical bug. Let me help investigate:

1. What browser and device were you using during checkout?
2. Did you see any error messages during the payment process?
3. Did you click the "Pay" button multiple times, or did it happen on a single click?

I'll trace the checkout flow to identify if there's a bug causing duplicate charges.
```

The flow: triage recognized a billing issue but the user mentioned "bug in your checkout system." The billing agent, recognizing the technical component, could transfer to triage (or in this run, triage routed directly to technical after analyzing the full message).

## Avoiding Handoff Loops

When agents can hand off to each other, infinite loops become possible:

```
Triage -> Billing -> Triage -> Billing -> ...
```

Prevent this with:

1. **Clear instructions**: Tell agents when NOT to hand off
2. **Conversation context**: Agents see handoff history and can recognize loops
3. **Maximum iterations**: The Runner has a `max_turns` parameter

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, RunConfig

result = Runner.run_sync(
    triage_agent,
    "Help me",
    run_config=RunConfig(max_turns=10)  # Limit total agent turns
)
```

## Complete Example: Support Routing System

Let's build a complete customer support system demonstrating all handoff patterns:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, handoff, function_tool, RunContextWrapper

--- Session Summary ---
Customer ID: CUST_12345
Handoff history: ['14:32:17: -> billing_agent']
Final agent: billing_agent

I can see you've been charged twice for your subscription last month. I found your account (CUST_12345, Professional plan).

Looking at your recent tickets, I see there's already an open billing dispute (#4530). Let me check the details of your duplicate charge:

1. Could you confirm the approximate amount of the duplicate charge?
2. Did both charges appear on the same day or different days?

If the duplicate charge is under $100, I can process a refund directly. If it's more, I'll escalate to our billing team for faster resolution.
```

## Progressive Project: Support Desk Assistant

Let's add **handoffs to specialist agents** to our Support Desk. When a case requires deep expertise, the triage agent hands off complete control---the specialist agent takes over the entire conversation.

### What You're Building

In Lessons 1-3, you built a Support Desk with tools and sub-agents. But sub-agents return results to the orchestrator. Now you'll add **true handoffs** where specialists take full ownership of the conversation:

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| Sub-agents (L03) | Orchestrator needs to coordinate multiple specialists |
| Handoffs (L04) | Specialist should own the entire interaction |

### Adding Specialist Handoffs

Now it's your turn to add handoffs to your Support Desk. Using the patterns from this lesson, create specialists that take over completely.

**Step 1: Extend your context model**

Add fields to track handoffs:
- `handoff_history`: list of strings to log transfers
- `session_start`: timestamp for the session

**Step 2: Create a handoff logging callback**

Using the [Handoff Callbacks](#handoff-callbacks-with-on_handoff) section as reference, create a factory function that logs when handoffs occur:
```python
def log_handoff(specialist_name: str):
    def callback(ctx: RunContextWrapper[SupportContext]):
        # Log the transfer with timestamp
        # Add to ctx.context.handoff_history
    return callback
```

**Step 3: Create specialist-specific tools**

Each specialist needs domain-specific tools:
- **Billing**: `lookup_billing_history` - returns payment records
- **Technical**: `check_warranty_status` - checks product warranty
- **Sales**: `generate_quote` - creates price quotes

**Step 4: Create the escalation agent**

This is the "end of the line" agent for cases requiring human review:
- No handoffs (it's the final destination)
- Documents issues thoroughly
- Confirms human follow-up

**Step 5: Create specialist agents with escalation paths**

Create three specialist agents using the [Basic Handoffs](#basic-handoffs-the-handoffs-list) pattern:
- **BillingSpecialist**: handles invoices, refunds up to $200, payment updates
- **TechnicalSpecialist**: handles setup, troubleshooting, warranty claims
- **SalesSpecialist**: handles quotes, pricing, upgrades

Each should:
- Have their domain-specific tool
- Have `handoffs=[escalation_agent]` for complex cases
- Include clear escalation criteria in instructions

**Step 6: Update main support desk with handoffs**

Use the `handoff()` function to configure transfers:
```python
handoffs=[
    handoff(
        billing_specialist,
        tool_name_override="transfer_to_billing",
        tool_description_override="Transfer to billing specialist",
        on_handoff=log_handoff("BillingSpecialist"),
        input_filter=handoff_filters.remove_all_tools
    ),
    # Similar for technical and sales...
]
```

**Step 7: Test routing scenarios**

Test three different customer messages:
1. Billing issue: "I was charged twice this month"
2. Technical issue: "My SmartHub won't connect to WiFi"
3. Sales inquiry: "I need a quote for 50 units"

Check that each routes to the correct specialist.

### Key Differences: Sub-agents vs Handoffs

| Aspect | Sub-agents (L03) | Handoffs (L04) |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Control | Orchestrator keeps control | Specialist takes over |
| Response | Sub-agent returns to orchestrator | Specialist responds directly |
| Use case | Need coordination | Need deep specialization |
| Context | Shared via context object | Passed via input_filter |

### Extension Challenge

Add **return paths** so specialists can hand back to the main desk:
```python
handoffs=[escalation_agent, support_desk]  # Can escalate OR hand back
```

### What's Next

Your specialists handle their domains, but what about bad actors? In Lesson 5, you'll add **guardrails** that block harmful inputs, validate outputs, and protect both your system and customers.

### Prompt 1: Design a Handoff Architecture

```
I'm building a customer support system for an e-commerce platform using OpenAI Agents SDK.

Design a handoff architecture with:
1. Triage agent as entry point
2. 4 specialist agents (orders, returns, payments, product questions)
3. Escalation path for complex issues
4. Appropriate input_filters for each handoff

For each handoff, explain:
- Why this agent handles this case
- What context should/shouldn't be passed
- When to escalate vs resolve
```

**What you're learning:** How to design multi-agent architectures with appropriate context flow between specialists. You're practicing the architectural thinking needed for production agent systems.

### Prompt 2: Implement Custom Filters

```
I have a support agent system where conversations can get long (50+ messages).
When handing off to a specialist, I want to:
1. Keep the last 10 user messages
2. Remove all tool calls
3. Add a summary of the issue at the start

Help me implement a custom input_filter function that does this.
Show the filter function and how to use it with handoff().
```

**What you're learning:** How to implement custom input filters that optimize context for receiving agents, balancing information preservation with token efficiency.

### Prompt 3: Apply to Your Domain

```
I want to build a multi-agent system for [YOUR DOMAIN: legal intake, medical triage,
financial advising, etc.].

Help me design:
1. What specialist agents do I need?
2. What should the triage agent's routing logic be?
3. Where should I use input_filters to protect sensitive information?
4. What handoff callbacks would be useful for compliance/logging?

Start with the agent architecture, then show implementation code.
```

**What you're learning:** Translating the handoff patterns to your specific domain, considering both technical implementation and domain-specific requirements like compliance.

### Safety Note

Handoffs transfer conversation context between agents. Be careful with:

- **Sensitive data**: Use input_filters to remove PII before handoffs to less-trusted agents
- **Circular handoffs**: Set max_turns in RunConfig to prevent infinite loops
- **Context size**: Long conversations consume tokens; filter aggressively for specialists
- **Audit logging**: Use on_handoff callbacks to maintain audit trails of who handled what
