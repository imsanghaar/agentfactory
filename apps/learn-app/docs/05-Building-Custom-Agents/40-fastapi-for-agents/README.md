# Chapter 40: FastAPI for Agents

**You will build a FastAPI skill BEFORE you learn FastAPI.**

This chapter follows the **Skill-First Learning Pattern**: In Lesson 0, you create a `fastapi-agent-api` skill using tools from Chapter 3. Then you spend the chapter understanding what you built and making it better. By the end, you don't just "know FastAPI"—you OWN a production-ready skill.

## Prerequisites

- **Chapter 3**: skill-creator and fetching-library-docs
- **Chapter 34**: OpenAI Agents SDK (Agent, Runner, function_tool)
- **Chapters 37-38**: MCP experience (HTTP/SSE patterns)
- **Part 5**: Python Fundamentals (async/await, type hints, Pydantic)

## The Running Example

**Lessons 1-10**: Build a Task API—production-ready CRUD with testing, database, auth, and dependency injection.

**Lessons 11-15**: Add infrastructure and agent integration—middleware, lifespan, streaming, and the key insight: **APIs are functions, functions become tools, agents use tools**.

## What You'll Own

```
.claude/skills/
├── skill-creator/           # From Chapter 3
├── fetching-library-docs/   # From Chapter 3
└── fastapi-agent-api/       # NEW - this chapter
```

This skill joins your growing **Digital FTE toolkit**.

## The Mindset Shift

**Traditional**: "Teach me FastAPI"
**Agent Factory**: "I own a FastAPI skill—help me make it better"

You're not here to learn. You're here to **build assets**.

Start with **Lesson 0: Build Your FastAPI Skill**.
