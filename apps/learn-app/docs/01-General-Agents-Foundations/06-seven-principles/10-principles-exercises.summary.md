This lesson provides 17 hands-on exercises across 8 modules (7 principle modules + 1 capstone module) that bridge the gap between understanding the Seven Principles and applying them instinctively. Three core skills run through every exercise: **principle recognition** (identifying which principle fits a scenario), **principle application** (using a principle to solve a concrete problem), and **workflow diagnosis** (spotting which principle was violated when something breaks). The **Principle Application Framework** guides students through a 7-step cycle: Identify, Diagnose, Plan, Execute, Verify, Compare, Generalize.

Each of the seven modules targets one principle — Bash is the Key, Code as Universal Interface, Verification as Core Step, Small Reversible Decomposition, Persisting State in Files, Constraints and Safety, and Observability — with a guided exercise (starter + better prompt) and a discovery exercise (diagnose what went wrong, no prompts provided). Module 8 offers three integration capstones: Project Rescue (fix a broken project), Workflow Design (create a starter kit), and Your Own Project (audit your real workflow).

Students self-assess using a 5-criteria rubric (Principle Recognition, Application Quality, Diagnosis Depth, Prompt Specificity, Reflection Quality) scored 1-4. After completing these exercises, students are prepared for the Chapter 6 Quiz in Lesson 11, which tests scenario-based principle reasoning.
