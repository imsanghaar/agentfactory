### Core Concept
General agents are powerful because they write code. Code is the universal interface through which agents interact with computers to accomplish any task. Unlike specialized tools with pre-built features, a general agent that writes code can solve any computational problem you can describe.

### Key Mental Models
- **The Specialist Trap**: Specialized agents (research agent, finance agent, writing agent) are limited to pre-built capabilities. If your needs do not match their features, you are stuck.
- **The General Agent Advantage**: One skilled problem-solver who can build tools for any job. Instead of selecting from pre-built features, the agent writes solutions tailored to your exact situation.
- **Code as the Interface**: Code is how agents communicate with computers. Through code, agents can do anything a computer can do, not just what some designer anticipated.

### The Five Powers of Code
1. **Precise Thinking**: Code executes with perfect precision. 127 × 89 always equals 11,303. No approximation, no fuzzy thinking.
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: Code captures entire workflows at once. All the steps, conditions, and logic run smoothly from start to finish.
3. **Organized Memory**: File systems let agents create, read, search, and organize information. Persistent storage across complex tasks.
4. **Universal Compatibility**: Code can read any format, transform any data, connect to any service. A universal translator between systems.
5. **Instant Tool Creation**: Anything you can describe, the agent can build. Custom solutions created on demand.

### Key Facts
- Anthropic discovered people use Claude Code for non-programming tasks: managing todos, organizing files, analyzing spreadsheets, sorting emails
- Specialized tools can only do what their creators built in (ten features, maybe twenty)
- General agents that write code have no such limits: whatever you can describe, they can build

### Critical Patterns
- **Describe what you want, not how to do it**: Focus on outcomes, let the agent figure out the code
- **Be specific about your situation**: "Organize my files" is vague; "Move all PDFs to 'PDFs' folder, images to 'Images', files older than one year to 'Archive'" is specific
- **Trust the collaboration loop**: You describe → agent writes code → you verify → you refine if needed

### Common Mistakes
- Trying to dictate implementation details ("write a Python script using the os module") instead of describing desired outcomes
- Being too vague about requirements, forcing multiple iterations to discover what you actually want
- Thinking you need to understand every line of code (what matters is whether the result matches your intent)
- Using specialized tools when a general agent could build exactly what you need

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Principle 1 (Bash is the Key) provides the terminal access that enables agents to write and execute code
- **Leads to**: Principle 3 (Verification as Core Step) because when agents write code, checking that it did what you wanted becomes essential
