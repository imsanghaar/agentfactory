This lesson provides 27 hands-on exercises across 8 modules for building, testing, and composing agent skills. Starting with Module 1 (understanding skills by dissecting existing SKILL.md files), students progress through creating first skills (Module 2), adding examples and templates (Module 3), referencing external documents like brand guides and policies (Module 4), systematic testing and iteration (Module 5), composing skills into pipelines and libraries (Module 6), and building production-ready skills for real business needs (Module 7). Three capstone projects challenge students to build complete skill suites for business operations, education, or personal productivity.

The exercises develop three core competencies: skill architecture (reading and writing SKILL.md files with proper structure), iterative development (testing against edge cases and measuring improvement with rubrics), and skill composition (chaining skills into multi-step workflows). Every exercise follows the six-step Skill-Building Framework: DEFINE the problem, DRAFT the first version, TEST on real examples, EVALUATE with a rubric, IMPROVE what's broken, and REPEAT until quality is consistent.

These exercises bridge the conceptual understanding from Lessons 08-09 into practical skill-building capability. Students who complete these exercises will be ready for Lesson 11: Subagents and Orchestration, where skills connect to delegation patterns, and Lesson 12: MCP Integration, where skills connect to external tools and services.
