# Skills, Subagents & MCP

With Claude Code running, this section teaches you to extend its capabilities. You'll learn how skills package reusable expertise, how subagents divide complex work, how MCP connects Claude to external tools, and how the settings hierarchy ties it all together.

**Lessons 8-14** build your understanding of Claude Code's extensibility architecture from individual skills through full MCP integration.
