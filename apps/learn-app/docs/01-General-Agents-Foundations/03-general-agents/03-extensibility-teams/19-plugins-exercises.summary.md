This lesson provides 17 hands-on exercises across 8 modules (7 extensibility modules + 1 capstone module) that bridge the gap between understanding Claude Code's extensibility features and using them fluently. Three core skills run through every exercise: **configuration management** (settings across scopes and precedence), **plugin lifecycle** (discover, install, package, distribute), and **automation design** (hooks and autonomous loops). The **Extensibility Workflow** guides students through a 6-step cycle: Identify, Check, Configure, Test, Package, Share.

Modules progress from individual capabilities to integrated systems: Settings Hierarchy, Hooks, Plugin Discovery, Plugin Usage, Plugin Packaging, Marketplace & Distribution, and Ralph Wiggum autonomous iteration. Each module has a hands-on exercise (with starter and better prompts) and a debug or evaluation exercise (diagnose what went wrong, no prompts provided). Module 8 offers three integration capstones: Full Plugin from Scratch, Team Extensibility Kit, and Your Own Workflow audit.

Students self-assess using a 5-criteria rubric (Configuration Accuracy, Hook Design, Plugin Competence, Debug Skill, Automation Quality) scored 1-4. After completing these exercises, students are prepared for the Chapter Quiz in Lesson 32. This lesson complements the existing Lesson 6 (basics exercises) and Lesson 10 (skills exercises), covering the extensibility layer of Claude Code mastery.
