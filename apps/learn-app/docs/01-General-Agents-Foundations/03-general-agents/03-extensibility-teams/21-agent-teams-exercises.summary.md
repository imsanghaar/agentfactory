This lesson provides 11 exercises across 5 modules that build proficiency in multi-agent orchestration through real business scenarios. Four professional domains are covered: knowledge work (Module 1), corporate operations (Module 2), entrepreneurship (Module 3), and freelance consulting (Module 4). Module 5 offers three capstones that integrate all concepts. Each module contains two exercises: a **hands-on exercise** (Exercise A) where students build a working multi-agent team with provided business data, and a **design exercise** (Exercise B) where students architect team structures on paper at zero API cost.

Four core skills thread through every exercise: **team orchestration** (TeamCreate, spawning, task assignment), **task pipeline design** (blockedBy dependencies, sequential and parallel stages), **inter-agent communication** (SendMessage, broadcast, structured debates), and **quality gate enforcement** (delegate mode, plan approval, review workflows). Starter files include realistic business data: market CSVs, competitor profiles, event budgets, venue options, guest lists, user surveys, revenue projections, client RFPs, reference proposals, customer reviews (200 rows), and business plans.

Students self-assess using a 4-criteria rubric (Comprehensiveness, Actionability, Evidence Quality, Team Coordination) scored 1-5, targeting 14/20 for module exercises and 16/20 for capstones. A **budget-friendly path** lets students complete all design exercises (1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.2) for free before investing API credits in hands-on work. After completing these exercises, students transition to Lesson 22 (Claude Cowork desktop interface). This lesson builds directly on Lesson 20 (Agent Teams foundations).
