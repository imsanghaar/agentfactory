# Claude Cowork

Claude Cowork brings agentic AI from the terminal to a desktop application that non-developers can use. This section covers getting started, practical workflows, browser integration with Claude in Chrome, MCP connectors that extend Cowork's reach, and the safety model that governs what Cowork can and cannot do.

**Lessons 22-28** give you hands-on experience with Claude's desktop agent and its ecosystem of connectors and built-in skills.
