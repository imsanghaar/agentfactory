# Lesson 22: From Terminal to Desktop - The Cowork Story

## Key Concepts

- **Claude Cowork**: Agentic AI in the Claude Desktop app with filesystem access for knowledge workers
- **Second Product Overhang**: After Claude Code's success, Anthropic launched Cowork (January 2026) to bring agentic AI to non-developers
- **Shared Foundation**: Both Code and Cowork run on Claude Agent SDK
- **Interface Difference**: Code uses terminal (developers), Cowork uses desktop GUI (knowledge workers)
- **Cross-Platform Skills**: Skills work in both interfaces

## Comparison Table

| Aspect          | Claude Code       | Claude Cowork                 |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Interface       | Terminal/CLI      | Desktop App GUI               |
| Primary Users   | Developers        | Knowledge Workers             |
| Best For        | Building software | Documents, data, organization |
| Same Foundation | Claude Agent SDK  | Claude Agent SDK              |

## When to Use Each

**Claude Code**: Writing code, running tests, git operations, debugging
**Claude Cowork**: Document processing, file organization, reports, presentations

## Mental Model

The same agentic AI, different interfaces. Skills transfer between both.
