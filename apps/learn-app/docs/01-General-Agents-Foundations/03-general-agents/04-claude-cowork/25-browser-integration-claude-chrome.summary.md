# Lesson 25: Browser Integration - Claude in Chrome

## What Browser Integration Enables

- Read current page content and structure
- Navigate between pages following links
- Extract structured data from websites
- Fill forms and submit inputs
- Clean up web-based interfaces (email inbox)

## Setup

1. Install Claude Chrome Extension
2. Connect to Claude Desktop
3. Grant permissions for target websites

## Example Workflow: Email Cleanup

**Task**: Analyze inbox, unsubscribe from old marketing emails, archive newsletters
**Result**: Inbox reduced from 2,143 to 347 messages, 12 unsubscriptions completed

## Speed Considerations

Browser automation is **slower** than file operations:

- Page load time: 1-5 seconds per operation
- DOM parsing and rendering required
- JavaScript execution delays

**Practical implication**: Start with simpler tasks, be patient with navigation

## When to Use Browser Integration

**Use for**: Web-based email cleanup, data extraction from dashboards, form filling, multi-page web workflows, research across websites

**Use file-based for**: Documents stored locally, already downloaded data, high-volume processing

## Security Tips

- Only activate Claude on pages where you want it to work
- Watch what Claude is doing (highlighted elements)
- Be cautious with sensitive sites (banking, password managers)
- Deactivate when done
