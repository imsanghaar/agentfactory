teaching_guide:
  lesson_type: "core"
  session_group: 11
  session_title: "Business Models and Industry Landscape"
  key_points:
    - "Skills are intellectual property that can be sold repeatedly — this is fundamentally different from selling time as a consultant"
    - "The Digital FTE model is the core value proposition: 24/7 availability, 90-95% cost savings per task, instant scaling"
    - "Four revenue models exist (subscription, success fee, license, marketplace) — students should identify which fits their domain"
    - "Students can start monetizing NOW with Skill licenses, done-for-you services, and consulting — they do not need Part 6 to begin"
  misconceptions:
    - "Students think they need to build a full production agent (Part 6) before they can make money — Skill licenses and consulting are available immediately"
    - "Students confuse the Digital FTE cost comparison with replacing all employees — Digital FTEs handle specific repetitive tasks, not entire job roles"
    - "Students assume the marketplace model is the easiest path — it requires volume and discoverability, while consulting and licensing offer faster first revenue"
  discussion_prompts:
    - "What expertise do you have that people currently pay consultants for, and how would you encode it into a SKILL.md that could be sold repeatedly?"
    - "Looking at the four revenue models, which one matches your risk tolerance and current network — and why?"
    - "The Digital FTE table shows 90-95% cost savings per task — what pushback would a skeptical buyer give, and how would you respond?"
  teaching_tips:
    - "Use the Digital FTE comparison table as a discussion anchor — have students calculate cost savings for a task from their own domain using the same format"
    - "Walk through the 30-Day Roadmap week by week and ask students to name their specific opportunity, task, and first potential customer"
    - "Distinguish the three 'you can sell today' models from the 'you need Part 6' capabilities — this prevents students from feeling they cannot act yet"
    - "Reference the Agent Factory workflow diagram (Expertise -> Specification -> Claude Code -> Agent + Skills -> Revenue) and have students map their own domain into it"
  assessment_quick_check:
    - "Name the four revenue models for AI agents from this lesson."
    - "What is a Digital FTE, and why is its cost-per-task lower than a human employee?"
    - "What can you sell today after Chapter 3, and what requires Part 6?"

# From Skills to Business: Monetizing Agent Expertise

You've learned to build Skills, MCP integrations, and subagents. But here's the key: **these are products, not just tools.**

Every Skill is intellectual property. The question isn't whether your work has value—it's how you capture that value.

---

## Skills Are Intellectual Property

A Skill is **encoded expertise** in a SKILL.md file. Unlike traditional consulting (sell your time, hourly rate), a Skill is **sold repeatedly**: encode once, sell thousands of times, improve over time. A Skill that automates financial audits serves unlimited customers simultaneously.

**Skills work across both interfaces:** A Skill you create works in Claude Code AND Claude Cowork. This means your expertise can serve both technical users (via Code) and knowledge workers (via Cowork), expanding your potential market.

---

## The Digital FTE Model

**Digital FTE**: An AI agent packaged as an employee unit, but with different economics:

| Metric       | Human Employee | Digital FTE     |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| Hours/week   | 40             | 168 (24/7)      |
| Monthly cost | $4-8K+         | $500-2K         |
| Ramp time    | 3-6 months     | Instant         |
| Turnover     | 20%/year       | Never           |
| Scaling      | Hire and train | Clone instantly |
| Consistency  | Variable       | 99%+ reliable   |

**Cost per task:**

- Qualify lead: Human $3-5 → Digital $0.25 (90% savings)
- Review contract: Human $50-100 → Digital $2-5 (95% savings)
- Generate report: Human $20-40 → Digital $1-2 (95% savings)

Companies adopt agents because they save money on work that must get done.

## Four Revenue Models

**1. Digital FTE Subscription ($500-2K/month)**
Host the agent. Client pays monthly. You provide: agent, hosting, maintenance, support.
Example: "Digital Contract Reviewer" for law firms. $1,200/month.

**2. Success Fee (Pay per Result)**
Charge $5 per qualified lead. 2% of cost savings. $50 per document processed.
Example: Lead qualification agent charging per sales-ready lead.

**3. License (Sell the Recipe)**
Sell SKILL.md files. Client runs it on their servers. Annual license fees.
Example: Compliance Skill licensed to banks for $50K/year.

**4. Skill Marketplace (Volume)**
Publish to OpenAI Apps. Users discover and pay subscription or usage fees.
Example: "Meeting Notes Summarizer." 10,000 users at $10/month = $100K/month.

---

## The Agent Factory Business Model

General Agents (Claude Code) build Custom Agents. Workflow:

```
Your Expertise → Specification → Claude Code → Custom Agent + Skills → Revenue
```

**Why it works:** Low creation cost (Claude Code does the work) + high resale value + infinite scalability = compounding returns.

**Case Study: Digital SDR**

- **Before**: 5 salespeople, 50 prospects/day, $40K/month
- **After**: 1 AI agent + 2 humans, 1,000+ prospects/day, $8K/month
- **Result**: 80% cost cut, 20x volume increase

You can start making money at step 3 (run the Skills yourself) before deploying as Custom Agents in Part 6.

---

## The Marketplace Opportunity

The OpenAI Apps marketplace (chatgpt.com/apps) has 800M+ users and no traditional sales friction. No 6-month sales cycles, no procurement, single-click adoption. Publish a great Skill with clear positioning, and the platform handles distribution. This is the "App Store moment" for AI—just as mobile apps created winners, AI agent marketplaces will too.

---

## Three Revenue Models You Can Use Today

After Chapter 3, you can sell:

**1. Skill Licenses ($500-5K)**
Create a SKILL.md solving a specific problem (e.g., "Financial Report Analyzer"). Package, document, license to others.

**2. Done-For-You Services (Flat Fee)**
Use Claude Code + your Skills to deliver results. Example: "I'll analyze your support tickets and generate a report: $500."

**3. Consulting + Handoff**
Build custom Skills for clients, connect them to their systems via MCP, train them, then hand off. Example: "2 weeks building Sales Skills for your CRM: $5K."

**What you CAN'T do yet** (Part 6):

- Customer-facing public agents
- 24/7 hosted agent APIs
- Production guardrails and safety controls

You don't need Part 6 to make money. Skills + MCP integrations = immediate consulting opportunity.

---

## The 30-Day Roadmap

**Week 1:** Identify your opportunity (what do others pay consultants to do?). Good candidates: document analysis, data extraction, report generation, content creation, process documentation.

**Week 2:** Build a SKILL.md for your chosen task. Add MCP connections (database, API, files). Test on real examples.

**Week 3:** Package and price. Document what it does. Create before/after examples. Decide: license, service, or hybrid? Price high.

**Week 4:** Find first customer. Start with people you know. Pilot at reduced rate. Get testimonials. Iterate.

---

## Try With AI

**🔍 Identify Your Expertise:**

> "What domain can I encode into a Skill? What questions do people ask repeatedly? What tasks do others find difficult?"

**What you're learning:** Expertise mining—recognizing what you know that others would pay for. The first step in any monetization strategy.

**💰 Calculate the Value:**

> "Pick one task. How much does it cost in human time? If an agent could do it for 10% of that cost, what are monthly/yearly savings?"

**What you're learning:** Value quantification—translating capability into dollars. This skill makes the business case for every AI product you build.

**🏗️ Design the Product:**

> "Which revenue model fits? What do I need to build (Skills, MCP, hosting)?"

**What you're learning:** Product design thinking—matching technical capabilities to business models. The connection between what you build and how it generates revenue.

## What's Next

Part 6 teaches you to build production Custom Agents with SDKs. You'll go from Skills (expertise packs) to full agents with guardrails and deployment. The business models here apply directly to those agents—but Custom Agents give you more control, reliability, and scalability.

Your journey from learner to builder to business owner begins now.
