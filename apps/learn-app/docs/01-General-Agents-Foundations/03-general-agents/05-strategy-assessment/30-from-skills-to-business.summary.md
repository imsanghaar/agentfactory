### Core Concept
Skills aren't just productivity tools—they're intellectual property that can be packaged and sold as Digital FTEs (Full-Time Equivalents), AI agents that work 24/7 at a fraction of human employee costs. The Agent Factory model turns domain expertise into recurring revenue through four monetization paths.

### Key Mental Models
- **Digital FTE Economics**: Human employee costs $4,000-8,000/month for 40 hours/week; Digital FTE costs $500-2,000/month for 168 hours/week (24/7) with instant ramp-up and zero turnover
- **Skills as Products**: Encoded expertise that solves problems repeatedly—not time sold once, but knowledge productized for infinite reuse
- **Agent Factory Workflow**: Your expertise → Specification → Claude Code builds it → Custom Agent + Skills → Revenue (subscription/license/marketplace/success fee)
- **Cost-Per-Task Advantage**: 85-95% savings per task (lead qualification, contract review, report generation) drives enterprise adoption

### Critical Patterns
- **Four Revenue Models**:
  1. **Subscription ($500-2,000/month)**: Host and manage agent, client pays monthly (recurring revenue, hands-off for client)
  2. **Success Fee (pay per result)**: Charge for outcomes ($5/lead, 2% savings, $50/document)—incentive-aligned, measurable value
  3. **License (sell the recipe)**: Sell Skills/code, client runs it ($50,000+/year for enterprises, data stays in-house)
  4. **Marketplace (volume play)**: Publish to platforms (OpenAI Apps), earn from usage/subscriptions at scale

- **Pricing Formula**: (Monthly savings from automation) ÷ 3 = Your monthly price (client gets 2x ROI, you get sustainable margins)

### Common Mistakes
- Selling time instead of productizing expertise—consulting mindset limits scale
- Underpricing based on cost instead of value delivered—a $2 agent saving $200/task should price based on savings, not API costs
- Not choosing revenue model aligned with client needs—regulated industries need licensing, growth startups prefer subscriptions
- Trying to build everything from scratch—Claude Code (General Agent) should build Custom Agents, not you manually coding them
- Ignoring the Digital FTE framing when selling to executives—CEOs understand "employee replacement economics" better than "AI automation"

### Connections
- **Builds on**: All Claude Code capabilities (Skills, MCP, Subagents, Hooks, Plugins) become monetizable assets
- **Leads to**: Building production Custom Agents (Part 6), deploying and scaling Digital FTEs (Part 7), creating sellable agent products
