# Lesson 4 Summary: Hello World & CLI Mastery

## Core Concept
Claude Code is not a chatbot; it's a **terminal-based agentic environment**. Mastering the interface—permissions, slash commands, and cost awareness—is the prerequisite for safe and effective development.

## Key Takeaways
- **The Permission Loop**: Claude cannot act without your approval. You must approve Read, Write, and Execute actions separately.
- **Slash Commands**: Use `/help`, `/clear`, `/compact`, and `/cost` to control the environment.
- **The Cost Pill**: Always monitor session cost (top right) to maintain token hygiene.
- **Steering**: You don't just say "yes/no"—you can guide Claude ("No, edit this file instead").
