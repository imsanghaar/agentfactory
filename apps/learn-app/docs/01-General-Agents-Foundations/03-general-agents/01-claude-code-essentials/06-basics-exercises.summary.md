This lesson provides 27 hands-on exercises across 8 modules, designed to bridge the gap between understanding AI agents (Lessons 01-05) and using them effectively on real problems.

Students practice three core skills throughout: **problem decomposition** (breaking vague problems into clear specifications), **specification writing** (describing outcomes precisely enough for an agent to execute), and **quality verification** (checking output against requirements and iterating to improve).

The exercises follow a 7-step Problem-Solving Framework: Define the Problem, Gather Context, Write the Spec, Execute, Verify, Iterate, and Reflect. Each exercise provides a realistic scenario, a starter prompt (intentionally vague), guidance toward a better prompt, and reflection questions.

The 8 modules progress from concrete to open-ended: File Organization (turning chaos into structure), Research & Synthesis (structuring broad questions), Data Wrangling (describing transformations in plain English), Document Creation (producing professional deliverables), Process Automation (writing reusable specifications), Problem Solving (using AI as a thinking partner), Quality Control (verifying and critiquing AI output), and Capstone Projects (combining all skills on self-directed projects).

Students self-assess using a 5-criteria rubric covering problem clarity, specification quality, output verification, iteration, and reflection. This lesson reinforces everything from the first five lessons and prepares students for Lesson 07: Teach Claude Your Way and Lessons 08-09: Agent Skills.
