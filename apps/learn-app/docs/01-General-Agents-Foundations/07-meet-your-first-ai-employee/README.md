# Chapter 7: Meet Your First AI Employee - OpenClaw

By February 2026, OpenClaw had crossed 209,000 GitHub stars — the fastest-growing repository in history. It proved something the industry had been debating: **AI Employees are real, they work, and people want them.**

This chapter is your test drive. You will set up a working AI Employee on Telegram for free, give it real work, understand how it works under the hood, create a custom skill, learn the security realities, watch it delegate coding tasks to Claude Code, connect it to your actual Google Workspace. We will also assess what OpenClaw proved and what remains unsolved, and meet NanoClaw a different architecture that addresses the security problems connecting to the Agent Factory blueprint for building AI Employees for every profession. Everything you learn here transfers to any agent framework.
