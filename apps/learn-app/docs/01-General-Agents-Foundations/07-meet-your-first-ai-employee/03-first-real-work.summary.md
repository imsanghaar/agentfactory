# Summary: Your First Real Work

## Key Concepts

- **Task Delegation with Iteration**: Delegate a task, review the output, then iterate -- request explanations, challenge rankings, edit the result
- **Agent Loop**: The 4-phase cycle (parse, plan, execute, report) that powers every task your agent runs
- **Output Judgment**: The value is not what the agent produces -- it is what YOU produce by editing agent output
- **Autonomous Invocation**: Scheduled tasks that run without prompting, turning a reactive tool into a daily employee
- **Daily Workflow Design**: Configure a personalized morning briefing tailored to your role and priorities

## The Agent Loop

1. **Parse** -- Understand the natural language instruction and resolve ambiguity
2. **Plan** -- Decide what to do and in what order before producing output
3. **Execute** -- Call tools (web search, file creation, file reading) as needed
4. **Report** -- Format output based on context (tables, checklists, prose)

## Common Mistakes

- Accepting agent output without reviewing it (first drafts are cheap; your judgment is expensive)
- Giving vague iteration feedback ("make it better") instead of specific feedback ("add X, remove Y")
- Skipping the morning briefing configuration (this is the lesson's lasting value)
- Expecting real-time data without verifying the model's knowledge cutoff
