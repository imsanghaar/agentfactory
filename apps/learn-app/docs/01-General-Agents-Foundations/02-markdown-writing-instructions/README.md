# Chapter 2: Markdown - Writing Instructions

Markdown is the **specification language** that lets you tell AI agents what to build. It's simple, structured, and understood by both humans and AI.

By the end of this chapter, you'll write clear specifications that AI agents can parse and implement - the foundation of AI-native development.

## 📚 Teaching Aid

## What You'll Learn

### **Lesson 1: Introduction to Markdown**

- Understand markdown's role in AI-driven development
- Learn how specifications form the Intent Layer
- See the difference between structured and unstructured communication

### **Lesson 2: Headings - Creating Document Hierarchy**

- Use `#` symbols to create heading structure
- Build clear document organization
- Help AI agents parse your specifications

### **Lesson 3: Lists - Organizing Ideas**

- Create bullet lists (`-`) for features and requirements
- Create numbered lists (`1.`) for sequential steps
- Choose the right list type for different contexts

### **Lesson 4: Code Blocks - Showing Examples**

- Use triple backticks to show code and output
- Add language tags (`python`, `bash`, `text`) for clarity
- Use inline code (single backticks) for commands and variables

### **Lesson 5: Links, Images & Your First Complete Specification**

- Create links `[text](url)` to documentation
- Add images `![alt](url)` to show screenshots and diagrams
- **Write your first complete specification** integrating all skills
- Validate your spec with AI feedback

This chapter teaches you to **collaborate with AI**, not memorize every markdown feature.
