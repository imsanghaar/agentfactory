  key_points:
    - "Code blocks eliminate specification ambiguity — showing exact expected output prevents AI from guessing format (the 4-greeting example makes this vivid)"
    - "Language tags (```python, ```bash, ```text) directly affect AI code generation — wrong tags cause wrong language output"
    - "Inline code (single backtick) vs fenced blocks (triple backtick) serve different purposes: references within text vs standalone multi-line examples"
    - "Showing edge cases in code blocks (like empty state) hints AI to handle those scenarios — if you don't show it, AI may not build it"
  misconceptions:
    - "Students confuse when to use inline code vs fenced blocks — inline is for short references in sentences (`pip install`), fenced is for multi-line examples"
    - "Students think language tags are optional cosmetic formatting — they directly affect how AI interprets and generates code"
    - "Students forget closing triple backticks — everything after becomes part of the code block, silently breaking the rest of the document"
  discussion_prompts:
    - "If you tell an AI 'the program should greet the user,' how many different outputs could it generate? How does showing exact expected output in a code block change that?"
    - "Why might tagging a Python code block as ```text cause an AI to generate lower quality code?"
  teaching_tips:
    - "Start with the opening example showing 4 possible greetings — this immediately demonstrates why code blocks matter for precise specifications"
    - "Have students physically locate the backtick key on their keyboard — many beginners struggle to find it (usually below Escape or left of 1)"
    - "The Lists vs Code Blocks comparison image connects back to Lesson 3 — use it to show the 'right tool for the job' principle"
    - "Emphasize the edge case pro-tip: showing what 'empty' looks like in a code block is a specification technique students will use repeatedly"
  assessment_quick_check:
    - "Ask students when to use inline code vs a fenced code block with an example of each"
    - "Ask students to name three common language tags and what type of content each is used for"

# Code Blocks - Showing Examples

When you're writing a specification that says:

> "The program should greet the user and show the current time."

An AI agent could generate code that prints:
- "Hello"
- "Hello World"
- "Hello! Time: 2:30pm"
- "Greetings, human. Current time: 14:30:00"

Which one do you actually want?

Now imagine you show the exact output in a code block:

```text
Hello! The time is 14:30:00
```

Suddenly there's no confusion. The AI knows exactly what format to use.

Code blocks let you show expected output, code examples, and command syntax directly in your specification. This lesson teaches you how to use them effectively.

### Lists vs Code Blocks

In the previous lesson, you learned lists for organizing content. Code blocks serve a different purpose — they preserve exact formatting. Here's the key distinction:

![Side-by-side comparison showing unordered lists (left panel: bullet points using dash syntax for features and independent items) versus fenced code blocks (right panel: triple backticks for showing code examples and command output). Demonstrates when to use each format based on content type.](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-3/chapter-10/lists-vs-code-blocks-distinction.png)

**Lists** organize ideas into readable bullet points or numbered steps. **Code blocks** preserve exact formatting — every space, every character appears exactly as you type it. Use lists to describe *what* the software does; use code blocks to show *what it looks like* when running.

---

## Concept 1: Fenced Code Blocks (Multiple Lines)

Use **fenced code blocks** when you need to show multiple lines of code or output.

### Basic Syntax

Create a fenced code block with **triple backticks** (the `` ` `` key, usually below Escape):

**What you type in your markdown file:**

````text
```
Line 1 of code or output
Line 2 of code or output
Line 3 of code or output
```
````

**What it renders as:**

```
Line 1 of code or output
Line 2 of code or output
Line 3 of code or output
```

Type three backticks, press Enter, type your code, press Enter, then type three more backticks. Everything between displays exactly as you type it (no markdown formatting applied).

:::tip[Pro-Tip: Documenting Code Blocks]
When writing documentation that shows code block syntax (like this lesson), use **quadruple backticks** (``````) to wrap examples containing triple backticks. This prevents the inner backticks from closing your outer block.
:::

### Example: Showing Expected Output

Here's a specification for a task list app:

**In your README.md:**
```text
When the user views tasks, they should see:
```

Then add a code block showing the expected output:

```
Tasks:
1. Buy groceries [Pending]
2. Call dentist [Complete]
3. Submit report [Pending]
```

The AI agent sees this and knows: "The output must show task number, description, and status on each line."

### Example: Showing Program Code

**In your spec:**
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Should print: 8
```

This shows the AI: "This is what the code should look like."

#### 💬 AI Colearning Prompt

> **Explore with your AI**: "I'm learning about code blocks in markdown. Can you show me what happens when I specify expected output in my specification vs when I don't? Create two versions of a spec for a greeting program—one with a code block showing exact output format, one without. Then explain which would produce more consistent results."

---

## Concept 2: Language Tags (For Clarity)

Add a **language tag** right after the opening backticks to specify what type of code it is.

### Syntax

Type three backticks, then the language name (no space), then your code:

**What you type:**

````text
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
````

**What it renders as:**

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

The word `python` is the language tag. It goes right after the opening triple backticks (no space).

### Common Language Tags

Use these tags based on what you're showing:

- **`python`** - Python code
- **`bash`** - Terminal commands
- **`text`** - Plain output (no code)
- **`typescript`** - TypeScript code
- **`json`** - Data formats
- **`yaml`** - Configuration files

:::warning[Use the Correct Tag]
AI agents are sensitive to language tags. If you tag Python code as `text`, the AI may ignore syntax rules and coding standards (like PEP 8). Always use the correct language tag so the AI generates properly formatted code.
:::

![Two code blocks comparing syntax highlighting: Left block shows code without language tag (plain text, no colors), right block shows Python code with ```python tag (keywords highlighted in color). Demonstrates how adding a language identifier enables syntax highlighting.](https://pub-80f166e40b854371ac7b05053b435162.r2.dev/books/ai-native-dev/static/images/part-3/chapter-10/code-block-syntax-highlighting.png)

### Why Language Tags Matter

Language tags help:
1. **Readers** understand what they're looking at
2. **AI agents** know what language to generate
3. **Code viewers** apply correct syntax highlighting

### Example: Installation Commands

**What you type in your README:**

````text
```bash
pip install requests
python app.py
```
````

**What it renders as:**

```bash
pip install requests
python app.py
```

The `bash` tag tells the AI: "These are terminal commands, not Python code."

### Example: Python Code

**What you type:**

````text
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```
````

**What it renders as:**

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

The `python` tag makes it clear this is Python code to implement.

:::info[Expert Insight]
Language tags do more than just enable syntax highlighting. They tell AI agents which language interpreter to use, which libraries might be available, and which syntax rules apply. When you tag a block as `python`, the AI knows to generate modern Python 3 syntax. When you tag it as `bash`, the AI knows these are shell commands. This prevents the AI from mixing syntaxes or generating code for the wrong language—a common error when language context is ambiguous.

## Concept 3: Inline Code (Single Backticks)

Use **inline code** for short code references within regular text - like variable names, commands, or file names.

### Syntax

Wrap your code reference in single backtick characters:

````text
Install the package with `pip install requests` command.
The `app.py` file contains the main function.
Set the `DEBUG` variable to `True` for testing.
````

**What it renders as:**

Install the package with `pip install requests` command.
The `app.py` file contains the main function.
Set the `DEBUG` variable to `True` for testing.

### When to Use Inline Code

Use single backticks for:
- Command names: `python`, `git`, `npm`
- Variable names: `user_name`, `total_count`
- File names: `README.md`, `app.py`
- Function names: `calculate_total()`, `get_user()`
- Short code snippets within sentences

### Example in a Specification

**In your spec, write:**

1. Install Python 3.9 or higher
2. Run `pip install requests` to install dependencies
3. Create a file named `config.py` with your API key
4. Run the program with `python weather.py`

Notice the difference: backticks visually separate code from prose, so readers never confuse a command like `pip install requests` with regular text. The same applies to file names (`config.py`) and function names (`get_weather()`).

#### 🤝 Practice Exercise

> **Ask your AI**: "Here's a specification without inline code formatting:
>
> 'Run pip install requests to install dependencies, then edit config.py with your API key, and run python weather.py to start the app.'
>
> Rewrite this with proper inline code formatting using backticks. Then explain why the formatted version is clearer. What happens if I don't format command names—how does that affect readability?"

## Fenced vs Inline: Which to Use?

| Feature | Syntax | Use Case |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Inline Code** | `` `code` `` | Variable names, file names, short commands in a sentence |
| **Fenced Block** | ` ``` ` | Multi-line code, program output, or implementation examples |

### Use Fenced Code Blocks (triple backticks) when:
- Showing multiple lines of code
- Displaying expected program output
- Sharing code examples to implement
- Showing error messages

### Use Inline Code (single backticks) when:
- Mentioning commands in a sentence
- Referring to variable or function names
- Listing file names
- Writing short code snippets in text

### Side-by-Side Examples

**Fenced block (multiple lines):**

```python
def calculate_total(prices):
    return sum(prices)

items = [10, 20, 30]
print(calculate_total(items))
```

**Inline code (within text):**

The `calculate_total()` function takes a list of `prices` and returns the sum.
Call it with `calculate_total([10, 20, 30])` to get `60`.

## Practice Exercise: Task Tracker App (Part 3 - Code Blocks)

**Continuing from Lesson 3**: Open your Task Tracker App specification. You'll now **add code blocks** to show expected output and clarify commands.

### Your Task for Lesson 4

Add code blocks to make your specification more concrete:

**Part 1: Add Expected Output Section**

Fill in the "Expected Output" section with a fenced code block showing what the program displays.

**What you should write in your spec:**

`````text
## Expected Output

When the user runs `python tracker.py`, they should see:

```text
Task Tracker Menu
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Mark Complete
4. Delete Task
5. Exit

Choose an option: _
```

When viewing tasks, the display looks like:

```text
Your Tasks:
1. Buy groceries [Pending] - Due: 2025-11-08
2. Call dentist [Pending] - Due: 2025-11-07
3. Submit report [Complete] - Done: 2025-11-06
```

When the task list is empty:

```text
Your Tasks:
No tasks yet. Use option 1 to add a task.
```
`````

:::tip[Pro-Tip: Show Edge Cases]
Including edge cases (like empty states) in your code blocks gives the AI a hint to handle these scenarios in the generated code. If you don't show what "empty" looks like, the AI might not handle it gracefully.
:::

**Part 2: Update Installation Commands**

Make sure your installation steps use **inline code** (single backticks) for commands.

**What you type** (notice the backticks around commands):

```text
## Installation

1. Install Python 3.9 or higher from python.org
2. Download the task tracker files from GitHub
3. Navigate to the project folder: `cd task-tracker`
4. Run the program: `python tracker.py`
```

**What it renders as** (backticks become formatted inline code):

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.9 or higher from python.org
2. Download the task tracker files from GitHub
3. Navigate to the project folder: `cd task-tracker`
4. Run the program: `python tracker.py`

**Part 3: Add Language Tags**

Ensure your code blocks have the `text` language tag (since this is program output, not Python code).

### Validation Checklist

Check your updated specification:

1. Expected output section has at least one fenced code block with `text` tag
2. Code blocks show what the program actually prints (not descriptions)
3. Installation commands use inline code (`` `cd task-tracker` ``, `` `python tracker.py` ``)
4. All code blocks have opening AND closing triple backticks
5. Output is specific (shows actual menu items, not "menu appears")

**Save this file!** You'll add links, images, and emphasis in Lesson 5 to complete it.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Forgetting Closing Backticks

**Wrong** (missing closing backticks — everything after becomes part of the code block):

````text
```python
print("Hello")

This text becomes part of the code block because there's no closing ```
````

**Correct:**

````text
```python
print("Hello")
```
````

Which renders as:

```python
print("Hello")
```

Always close your code blocks with triple backticks.

### Mistake 2: Using Inline Code for Multiple Lines

**Wrong:**
The code is `def add(a, b): return a + b` (inline code with multiple lines doesn't work)

**Correct:**
The code is:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Use fenced blocks for multiple lines.

### Mistake 3: No Language Tag When It Matters

**Unclear (no language tag):**

````text
```
pip install requests
```
````

**Clear (with `bash` tag):**

````text
```bash
pip install requests
```
````

Adding the `bash` tag makes it clear this is a terminal command, not Python code or plain text.

---

## Why This Matters for AI

When you use code blocks correctly, AI agents can:

1. **See exact output format** - "The program prints 3 lines with this structure"
2. **Understand the language** - "This is Python code, not bash commands"
3. **Parse code examples** - "This is example code to implement, not expected output"
4. **Follow command syntax** - "These inline codes are commands to run"
5. **Semantic anchoring** - When you wrap a command in backticks like `python tracker.py`, you tell the AI: "This is a literal string, not a word to translate or summarize." This prevents the AI from hallucinating different command names.

Code blocks eliminate the gap between "what you described" and "what you meant." When AI can see the exact output you expect, it builds to match.

:::info[Expert Insight]
In professional development, code blocks serve as executable documentation. When you show expected output in a fenced code block, that becomes the acceptance test—did the generated code produce exactly this output? This practice, called "specification by example," reduces ambiguity dramatically. Concrete examples are easier to understand and harder to misinterpret than abstract descriptions, so everyone (human and AI) can see exactly what "correct" looks like — reducing miscommunication and rework during implementation.

## Try With AI

Validate your Task Tracker App code blocks with AI feedback — and test execution.

### Setup

Use any AI assistant you have access to — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another tool.

:::tip[Verification Reminder]
Prompt 3 below asks AI to implement your spec — this is a great way to test whether your code blocks are clear enough. If the generated code doesn't match your expected output, your spec needs work, not the AI.
:::

### Exercise

Take your **updated Task Tracker App specification** (now with code blocks) and ask your AI:

**Prompt 1 (Structure Check):**

```
I'm learning code blocks in markdown. Can you check if I used the right syntax?

[Paste your specification here]

Tell me:
1. Are my code blocks properly closed?
2. Did I use appropriate language tags?
3. Should any inline code be fenced blocks instead?
```

**Prompt 2 (Clarity Check):**

```
Based on my specification, can you tell:
1. What should the program output look like?
2. What programming language is this written in?
3. What commands need to be run?
```

**Prompt 3 (Implementation + Execution Test):**

```
Can you implement a simple version of this Task Tracker App specification?
Generate Python code that shows the main menu and displays sample tasks
like I specified in the Expected Output section.
```

### Expected Outcomes

From **Prompt 1**: Your AI confirms your code block syntax is correct

From **Prompt 2**: Your AI can parse your specification and understand output format, language, and commands

From **Prompt 3**: Your AI generates Python code matching your expected output
