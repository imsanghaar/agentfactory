This lesson provides 27 hands-on exercises across 8 modules, designed to bridge the gap between understanding Spec-Driven Development (Lessons 01-08) and applying it to real-world problems. Students practice three core skills throughout: **specification writing** (transforming vague goals into structured documents with goals, constraints, and success criteria), **research and refinement** (gathering multi-angle context and surfacing hidden assumptions through structured interviews), and **task delegation** (decomposing specifications into atomic, dependency-ordered tasks suitable for agent execution).

The exercises follow a 6-step SDD Exercise Framework: Research, Specify, Refine, Execute, Verify, and Iterate. The 8 modules progress from foundational to comprehensive: Spec vs. Vibe (experiencing the difference firsthand), Research Phase (multi-angle investigation and source reliability), Writing Your First Spec (transforming messy input into structure), Constraints & Success Criteria (writing verifiable guardrails), Refinement (interview techniques and ambiguity hunting), Task Breakdown & Delegation (atomic tasks and dependency mapping), Full SDD Cycle (end-to-end projects), and Capstone Projects (complete SDD workflows on complex real-world scenarios).

Students self-assess using a 5-criteria rubric covering research quality, spec completeness, constraint coverage, refinement depth, and task delegation. No exercises involve writing code — SDD is practiced as a general thinking methodology applicable to event planning, business operations, and any complex project. This lesson prepares students for the Chapter 5 Quiz.
