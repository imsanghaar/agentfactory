### Core Concept

Domain expertise is the product foundation for Digital FTEs -- the critical difference between using AI as a productivity tool (where AI eventually competes with your labor) and encoding your expertise into a sellable AI product (where AI delivers your knowledge at scale). Success requires positioning at the right competitive layer, understanding unit economics, choosing appropriate monetization models, and entering markets through the Piggyback Protocol Pivot (PPP) strategy.

### Key Mental Models

- **Sarah vs Marcus**: Sarah uses AI to work faster (AI competes with her labor); Marcus encodes 15 years of expertise into a Digital FTE he owns (AI delivers his knowledge at scale). The critical difference is product ownership vs tool usage.
- **Snakes and Ladders Framework**: Four competitive layers -- Layer 1 (Consumer AI Backbone: avoid this snake), Layer 2 (General Agents as Developer Tools: first ladder), Layer 3 (Custom Agents for Vertical Markets: where real money accumulates), Layer 4 (Orchestrator Layer: build toward, don't start here).
- **The 90-10 Principle**: 90% of work is mechanical (Digital FTE does 50x cheaper, 24/7); 10% requires human judgment. Result: same expertise output at 20% cost with 5x capacity.
- **Piggyback Protocol Pivot (PPP)**: Phase 1 (Infrastructure Layering, months 0-6: become the bridge between fragmented incumbent systems), Phase 2 (Market Validation, months 6-18: reach 60-80 customers, prove retention), Phase 3 (Strategic Pivot, months 18+: layer Custom Agents on infrastructure bridge).
- **Shadow Mode Deployment**: Three-phase risk reduction -- Shadow Mode (agent runs parallel, humans decide), Augmented (humans use agent input, still decide), Selective Automation (agent handles low-risk decisions, humans handle high-risk).

### Key Facts

- **Digital FTE cost efficiency**: Human support agent costs ~$150/ticket ($6,000/month, 20 tickets/day); Digital FTE costs ~$3/ticket ($1,500/month, 500+ tickets/day) -- 50x more efficient
- **Digital SDR economics**: $1,500/month subscription, $600/month cost = 60% gross margin; client saves $4,500/month vs human SDR
- **License model economics**: $25,000/year per client, $6,000/year cost = 76% margin (healthcare example)
- **Marketplace model**: Platform typically takes 70% revenue share; need 167+ users at $3/user to break even
- **PPP timeline to $5-10M ARR**: Approximately 24-36 months
- **PPP CAC advantage**: 60-80% lower customer acquisition cost than direct competition
- **Pivot trigger criteria**: 60-80 active accounts, >90% retention, 10-15% monthly MRR growth

### Critical Patterns

- Four monetization models with distinct tradeoffs: Subscription (recurring revenue, high support), Success Fee (aligned incentives, measurement challenge), License (enterprise compliance, long sales cycle), Marketplace (volume/passive, brutal discovery)
- Three requirements for vertical success: Domain Expertise (via fine-tuning OR vertical intelligence), Deep Integrations (read AND write to incumbent systems), Complete Agentic Solutions (end-to-end problems, not slices)
- Six pitfalls when agents create unacceptable risk: autonomous legal decisions, unauthorized financial transactions, unmonitored medical recommendations, biased hiring, untracked data access, no audit trail
- Red flag framework: 1 signal = yellow flag (additional review); 2+ signals = red flag (reconsider); 3+ signals = stop and redesign

### Common Mistakes

- Positioning as "I use AI better than you" when the real moat is "I know the domain so deeply I can tell when AI's generic answer misses something critical" (the 10% insight gap is the moat)
- Trying to compete at Layer 1 (Consumer AI Backbone) where only two players survive instead of climbing to Layer 3 (vertical markets) where incumbents cannot respond quickly
- Assuming the accuracy/reliability tradeoff kills the business case when shadow mode deployment with honest timelines (78% accuracy month 1, 94% by month 6) builds client trust
- Missing any one of the three requirements: domain expertise without integrations means sandbox-building; integrations without expertise means a replicable wrapper; expertise plus integrations without agentic solutions means just a data pipeline
