### Core Concept
AI-Driven Development (AIDD) is a specification-first methodology defined by nine characteristics (Specification-Driven, AI-Augmented, Agent-Orchestrated, Quality-Gated, Version-Controlled, Human-Verified, Iteratively-Refined, Documentation-Embedded, Production-Ready) and enabled by nine concrete technology pillars that together eliminate the specialist silos historically required for end-to-end software development, enabling a new M-Shaped developer profile.

### Key Mental Models
- **System Completeness over Individual Skill**: Maya built a production platform in one week not through superhuman effort but because the nine pillars eliminated barriers that previously required specialist silos. The system effect -- pillars amplifying each other -- is what creates the advantage.
- **Nine Pillars as Barrier Removers**: Each pillar addresses one specific barrier: AI CLI (working alone), Markdown as Programming (cognitive load of syntax), MCP (tool integration complexity), AI-First IDEs (human-AI friction), Linux Universal Env (platform fragmentation), TDD (fear of breaking things with AI code), SDD (ad-hoc chaos), Composable Skills (re-solving problems), Cloud Deployment (infrastructure complexity).
- **M-Shaped Developer Profile**: Deep expertise in 2-4 complementary domains (vs T-shaped with one deep expertise). Previously impossible because mastering multiple domains was cognitively overwhelming; AI augmentation makes it achievable by providing expert-level assistance outside your primary expertise.
- **Partial vs Complete Adoption**: 6/9 pillars creates competent but gap-riddled capability; 9/9 creates consistent, end-to-end advantage. Historical parallels: Cloud Computing, Agile, Mobile-First all showed early complete adopters thriving while partial adopters struggled.
- **Integration Creates the System Effect**: Pillars depend on each other -- Composable Skills need MCP for tools, SDD for structure, and Markdown for definition. Removing any pillar degrades the system; removing several returns you to traditional development.

### Key Facts
- **Nine AIDD Characteristics**: Specification-Driven, AI-Augmented, Agent-Orchestrated, Quality-Gated, Version-Controlled, Human-Verified, Iteratively-Refined, Documentation-Embedded, Production-Ready
- **Nine Pillars**: (1) AI CLI & Coding Agents, (2) Markdown as Programming Language, (3) MCP Standard, (4) AI-First IDEs, (5) Linux Universal Dev Environment, (6) TDD, (7) SDD with SpecKit Plus, (8) Composable Vertical Skills, (9) Universal Cloud Deployment
- **Traditional team equivalent**: 4-5 specialists (backend architect, frontend engineer, DevOps, security specialist, data engineer) replaced by one M-shaped developer using all nine pillars
- **Realistic learning pathway**: Months 1-6 (Pillars 1-3), Months 7-12 (Pillars 4-6), Months 13-18 (Pillars 7-9), Year 2+ (mastery and depth)
- **AI learning acceleration**: 3-5x faster skill acquisition with AI as coding partner
- **Key tools per pillar**: Claude Code/Gemini CLI (Pillar 1), Zed/Cursor (Pillar 4), WSL2/Docker (Pillar 5), Kubernetes/Dapr/Kafka/Ray (Pillar 9)

### Critical Patterns
- Pillar integration chains: Composable Skills (P8) needs MCP (P3) for tool integration, SDD (P7) for structure, and Markdown (P2) for definition; AI Agents (P1) are more effective with AI-First IDEs (P4), TDD (P6), and MCP (P3)
- M-shaped development has realistic constraints: domain depth still matters for security/regulatory/safety; domain compatibility varies; organizational context shapes application; execution quality still determines outcomes
- The convergence that made AIDD possible: advanced AI models + structured agent frameworks + modern dev tools + containerization + API-first architectures + open-source ecosystems + DevOps automation + universal dev environments
- Pillar 7 (SDD) orchestrates all others: it uses Markdown specs (P2), leverages AI agents (P1), enforces TDD (P6), and deploys via cloud (P9)

### Common Mistakes
- Treating the nine pillars as a menu of optional tools rather than an integrated system where each pillar amplifies the others (partial adoption creates bottleneck gaps)
- Assuming M-shaped development means you no longer need deep expertise in anything (AI augments but does not replace years of specialized experience in critical areas like security and regulatory compliance)
- Starting all nine pillars simultaneously rather than following the progressive pathway (foundations first: AI agents, Markdown specs, MCP; then intermediate; then advanced)
- Confusing AIDD characteristics (what it IS: Specification-Driven, AI-Augmented, etc.) with the nine pillars (HOW it works: the concrete technologies that enable those characteristics)

### Connections
- **Builds on**: The orchestrator role (Lesson 2) that the pillars enable; the Five Powers and AI Stack (Lesson 3) that provide Layer 1-3 infrastructure; AIFF Standards (Lesson 4) specifically MCP and Skills which are pillars 3 and 8
- **Leads to**: Spec-Driven Development (Lesson 7) which is Pillar 7 explored in depth; the practical chapters (Parts 5-7) where students implement all nine pillars hands-on through the skill-first learning pattern
