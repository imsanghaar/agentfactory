### Core Concept
The year 2025 represents a genuine inflection point where three independent trends converge: AI capability reaches production quality, mainstream developer adoption passes the tipping point, and enterprises bet billions on AI-native architecture. This convergence validates the Two Paths Framework -- General Agents (multi-purpose reasoning tools like Claude Code) and Custom Agents (purpose-built products via SDKs) -- where General Agents serve as factories that build Custom Agents.

### Key Mental Models
- **Two Paths Framework**: General Agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Goose) are flexible reasoning partners for exploration; Custom Agents (OpenAI SDK, Claude SDK, Google ADK) are specialized production systems. They are complementary, not competing.
- **Agent Factory Paradigm**: General Agents BUILD Custom Agents -- you explore and prototype with a General Agent, then transition stable patterns into engineered Custom Agents for production.
- **Convergent Validation**: When the same signal appears from independent sources (academia, surveys, startups, corporate acquisitions), it indicates real transformation rather than coordinated hype.
- **Director vs Builder Roles**: With General Agents your role is Director (specify intent, evaluate quality); with Custom Agents your role is Builder (design, engineer, govern).
- **Software Self-Disruption**: Unlike other industries disrupted by external forces, software disrupts itself -- making the transition faster and more complete because tools, workflows, and mental models shift simultaneously.

### Key Facts
- **ICPC 2025**: OpenAI ensemble achieved a perfect score (12/12 problems); Gemini 2.5 solved 10/12 including one problem no human team solved
- **GDPval Benchmark**: Claude Opus 4.1 achieved 49% win rate vs human experts; GPT-5 reached 40.6% (up from below 15% eighteen months prior)
- **Stack Overflow 2025**: 84% of developers use or plan to use AI coding tools; 51% report daily use
- **DORA 2025**: 90% adoption rate among development professionals; 2 hours/day median AI usage
- **Y Combinator W25**: 25% of startups use AI-generated code as primary development approach
- **Workday acquisition of Sana**: $1.1 billion for AI-powered workplace agents (September 2025)
- **$3 trillion developer economy**: 30 million developers at ~$100K average economic value per year

### Critical Patterns
- The General-to-Custom pipeline: Explore with General Agent -> Transition to Custom Agent -> Scale the Product -> Use General Agent to optimize and build next generation
- Opportunity windows in tech transitions last 3-5 years; AI-native development is at year 1-2 (2025)
- The development lifecycle follows four phases: General Agent Phase -> Translation Phase -> Custom Agent Phase -> Continuous Improvement Phase
- Custom Agents exist because General Agents trade flexibility for speed, reliability, governance, and production-readiness

### Common Mistakes
- Treating General and Custom Agents as competitors rather than understanding they serve different purposes in a pipeline (General Agents explore; Custom Agents execute at scale)
- Dismissing 2025 evidence as hype without recognizing convergent validation from independent sources (academic, survey, startup, and financial signals all align)
- Waiting to learn AI-native development until best practices are settled (the opportunity window is NOW; waiting means learning others' conventions instead of shaping them)
- Assuming traditional CS skills (syntax mastery, algorithm optimization) are sufficient when the key skills have shifted to specification writing, agent design, and validation

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Basic understanding of what AI is and awareness of the software development landscape
- **Leads to**: Understanding the role evolution from coder to orchestrator (Lesson 2), the Five Powers and AI Stack architecture (Lesson 3), and ultimately the Agent Factory paradigm that structures the entire book
