### Core Concept

The most brilliant AI solution is worthless if you can't sell it. Enterprise sales success requires understanding buyer personas, solving their three core challenges, and aligning pricing with measurable outcomes—not just building better technology.

### Key Mental Models

- **Six Selection Factors**: What enterprises actually prioritize: customization, partnership ecosystem, consultative approach, domain expertise, business-unit focus, and outcome-based pricing
- **Three Core Challenges**: Integration complexity, limited technical expertise, and security vulnerabilities—solve these to become invaluable
- **Gen AI Paradox**: 75%+ of companies adopted AI but see no earnings impact—creating massive opportunity for providers who deliver measurable outcomes

### Critical Patterns

- Tailor pitch to buyer persona: CFO (ROI, cost reduction), COO (efficiency, scale), CIO/CTO (integration, security), CEO (competitive advantage)
- Handle objections with data: "We tried AI before" → "75% saw no impact because they lacked outcome focus"
- Use outcome-based pricing: subscription, fixed-price, or gain-share—70%+ of enterprises prefer this over hourly rates
- Follow implementation phases: Discovery (4-6 weeks) → Prototype (6-8 weeks) → Pilot (8-12 weeks) → Scale (3-6 months)
- Build partnerships from day one: hyperscalers, LLM providers, vertical specialists, SaaS vendors

### Common Mistakes

- Positioning as "cheapest option" when enterprises value outcomes over price
- Speaking technology to business buyers instead of business outcomes
- Using time-and-materials pricing when the market has shifted to outcome-based models
- Trying to sell alone without a partnership ecosystem for credibility
