### Core Concept
The developer role is fundamentally shifting from typist (manually implementing code) to orchestrator (directing AI systems with judgment and specification). This shift is powered by the OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act), which distinguishes passive AI prediction from agentic AI reasoning, and has progressed through four generations of AI tools culminating in autonomous agents.

### Key Mental Models
- **Typist vs Orchestrator**: Typists write code from brain to keyboard; Orchestrators think through problems first, direct AI to implement, then validate results. The key shift is from "what I must do" to "what I must direct."
- **The Judgment Layer**: Humans provide judgment (what success looks like, which tradeoffs matter, what constraints exist, what the specification is, whether AI's work is correct) while AI provides execution (code generation, pattern application, syntax, documentation).
- **OODA Loop**: Observe-Orient-Decide-Act is the continuous reasoning cycle that distinguishes autonomous agents from passive AI. Agents loop until goals are achieved rather than generating a single prediction.
- **Four AI Tool Generations**: Gen 1 (autocomplete) -> Gen 2 (function generation) -> Gen 3 (feature implementation) -> Gen 4 (autonomous agents). Each generation expands the scope of autonomous capability.
- **Compounding Productivity**: The orchestrator approach compounds over time -- 10 features take 100 hours (vs 400 for typists) while producing better documentation and tested code.

### Key Facts
- **80% of traditional developer work** falls into three categories AI handles well: mechanical repetition, pattern application, and context transfer (intent to syntax)
- **Traditional project**: 140 hours for a release (20 planning + 80 coding + 30 testing + 10 deployment)
- **AI-orchestrated project**: 33 hours for the same release (20 planning + 8 coding + 3 testing + 2 deployment)
- **Gen 1 (2021-2022)**: GitHub Copilot launched line-by-line suggestions
- **Gen 2 (2022-2023)**: ChatGPT enabled entire function generation from plain English
- **Gen 3 (2023-2024)**: Cursor and similar tools introduced multi-file codebase-aware changes
- **Gen 4 (2024-2026)**: Claude Code, Devin, GitHub Copilot Workspace enable autonomous multi-step orchestration
- **Current state (2026)**: Early transition into Gen 4; tools are rapidly improving; best practices still being discovered

### Critical Patterns
- In every SDLC phase (Planning, Coding, Testing, Deployment, Operations), human work shifts from execution to judgment -- setting the bar, directing the work, and validating the result
- The orchestrator skill stack prioritizes: problem decomposition and specification, quality validation and judgment, constraint analysis and tradeoffs, prompting and direction
- Gen 4 agents still have limitations: hallucination under pressure, constraint comprehension gaps, quality monitoring blindness, and long-context decision fatigue
- Value shifts from lines-of-code-per-day to how much intelligence you can direct effectively

### Common Mistakes
- Confusing orchestration with delegation ("give the AI a task and hope") when orchestration is actually informed direction of intelligent systems requiring problem clarity, constraint awareness, and quality standards
- Thinking you no longer need programming knowledge as an orchestrator (you still must understand code to validate AI output -- you just spend less time typing it)
- Assuming Gen 4 tools are mature with stable best practices (we are in early transition; adaptability matters more than memorizing fixed patterns)
- Treating AI transformation as only affecting the coding phase when it transforms ALL five SDLC phases (Planning through Operations)
