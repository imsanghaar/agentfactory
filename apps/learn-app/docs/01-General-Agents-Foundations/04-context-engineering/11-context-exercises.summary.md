This lesson provides 14 hands-on exercises across 7 modules plus 3 capstone projects, structured as a progressive **Context Lab** where students transform a broken Contract Review Agent into a production-quality system. Three core skills run through every exercise: **context diagnosis** (identifying rot types and classifying signal vs. noise), **context architecture** (mapping information to the correct context tool and calculating token budget impact), and **context engineering** (building persistent, lifecycle-managed, memory-enhanced agents with clean multi-agent isolation). Each module applies one technique and measures the improvement using a consistent 4-criteria scoring rubric (Completeness, Accuracy, Consistency, Actionability).

The seven modules progress from foundational to advanced: Context Rot (audit and baseline measurement), Signal vs. Noise (4-question audit and quality comparison), Context Architecture (tool mapping and token budgeting), Persistence (task DAGs, tacit knowledge extraction, and /clear survival testing), Lifecycle (zone monitoring and compaction strategy), Memory (corpus design and drift measurement), and Isolation (multi-agent pipeline design and clean-vs-dirty comparison). Three capstones integrate all techniques: build a domain agent for your own profession, execute a 3-session context relay project, and diagnose three failing agents with different context problems.

Assessment is measurement-driven throughout. Students score agent output on a 1-5 scale across four criteria after every module, tracking improvement from a typical baseline of 25-35 points to a final score of 50-58 out of 60. A 5-criteria Context Engineering Assessment Rubric (Context Diagnosis, Architecture Design, Persistence Engineering, Lifecycle Management, Advanced Patterns) provides the summative evaluation. This lesson prepares students for the Chapter 4 Quiz in Lesson 12.
