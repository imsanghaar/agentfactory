# Chapter 4: Effective Context Engineering with General Agents

You've learned how to use Claude Code and Cowork. You know the tools—CLAUDE.md, Skills, Subagents, Hooks, MCP. Now comes a harder question: **Why do some agents work brilliantly while others fail?**

Two engineers build contract review agents. Same model. Same basic architecture. One sells for $2,000/month. The other can't give it away. What's different?

**The answer: context quality.**

This chapter introduces **Context Engineering**—the quality control discipline for Digital FTE manufacturing. Just as Toyota has systematic practices ensuring every car meets specification, context engineering ensures your Digital FTEs deliver consistent, sellable value.

Remember the thesis: **General Agents BUILD Custom Agents.** Context engineering is HOW you ensure those Custom Agents are worth buying.
