This lesson provides 15 hands-on exercises across 6 modules plus 3 capstone projects, practicing the three skills that make Git second nature: **repository management** (building clean, well-structured projects), **problem diagnosis** (reading Git output to find and fix broken state), and **professional workflows** (PRs, transparency, and reusable patterns). Every exercise uses a real Git repository with actual commands, guided by the six-step Git Safety Framework: Assess, Plan, Protect, Execute, Verify, Document.

The modules progress from Repository Foundations (Module 1) through Change Tracking & Recovery (Module 2), Branch Strategies (Module 3), GitHub & Remote Workflows (Module 4), Pull Requests & Code Review (Module 5), and Workflow Documentation (Module 6), culminating in three capstone projects: Full Stack Git Journey (integration), Portfolio Launch (real-world), and Git Forensics (investigation). Exercises alternate between Build (create from scratch) and Debug (fix broken state) patterns, with early modules providing starter and better prompts while later modules remove scaffolding.

Students assess their work using a five-criteria rubric covering Command Accuracy, Safety Awareness, Diagnosis Skill, Workflow Discipline, and Recovery Confidence, each scored 1-4. A score of 15 or higher out of 20 indicates readiness for autonomous Git workflows. Next: the Chapter Quiz tests conceptual understanding of Git scenarios, then Chapter 13 where you'll build your own AI Employee that uses these same version control patterns to work autonomously on projects.
