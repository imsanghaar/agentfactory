This lesson provides 14 hands-on exercises across 6 modules plus 3 capstone projects, bridging the gap between understanding Linux operations and executing them fluently under production pressure. Three core skills are practiced throughout: **Linux system administration** (applying filesystem navigation, text processing, scripting, service management, and debugging to realistic server scenarios), **production debugging** (diagnosing service failures, security violations, broken scripts, and cascading errors by systematic layer-by-layer investigation), and **deployment pipeline design** (combining all skills into automated, idempotent, reversible workflows). Every exercise uses the seven-step Linux Operations Framework: Investigate, Plan, Backup, Execute, Verify, Document, Automate.

The modules progress from foundational server mapping (Module 1: Filesystem Recon) through text pipeline construction (Module 2: Text & Pipes), session and script automation (Module 3: Sessions & Scripting), log forensics and security auditing (Module 4: Logs & Security), service configuration and startup debugging (Module 5: Networking & Services), and cascade failure tracing with end-to-end deployment pipelines (Module 6: Debugging & Workflows), culminating in three capstone projects that synthesize all skills. Early modules provide starter and better prompts to scaffold learning; later modules remove prompts so students design their own approaches.

Key mental models include: the Linux Operations Framework (7-step process ensuring investigation precedes action), the cascade trace technique (following failures through nginx -> gateway -> application -> cache -> database layers), and the idempotency principle (scripts that produce the same result whether run once or ten times). Common mistakes to avoid: changing files without first investigating current state, skipping backups before destructive operations, running services as root when a dedicated user is safer, and diagnosing by guessing instead of reading logs systematically.

Students assess their work using a six-criteria rubric covering investigation quality, operational safety, security posture, debugging methodology, automation maturity, and documentation completeness. These exercises prepare students for autonomous agent operations in later chapters, where the patterns practiced here become the foundation for Digital FTEs managing production infrastructure independently.
