# Lesson 0 Summary: Personal AI Employee Specification

## Key Concepts

1. **Digital FTE Architecture**: Perception (watchers detect events) → Reasoning (Claude Code analyzes) → Action (MCP servers execute) — the three-layer pattern underlying every component

2. **Tiered Deliverables**: Bronze (email assistant), Silver (watchers + HITL + scheduling + CEO Briefing), Gold (full autonomous pipeline), Hackathon (build from scratch)

3. **Permission Boundaries**: Actions classified as auto-approve (read-only, drafts) vs require-approval (sending emails, financial transactions, data deletion)

4. **Known Contacts Rule**: People you've exchanged 3+ emails with in the past 90 days AND whose address is in your contacts or CRM

5. **Security Model**: Credentials in `.env` (never in vault), MCP for external service access, HITL gates for sensitive operations

## Deliverables

- Understanding of the full Personal AI Employee architecture
