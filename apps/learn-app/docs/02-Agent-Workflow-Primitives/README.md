# Part 2: Agent Workflow Primitives

You understand the paradigm. You know the Seven Principles. You've seen what an AI Employee can do (Chapter 7).

**Now it's time to build the skills to create your own.**

This part is a progressive skills lab. Each chapter tackles a specific problem domain — organizing files, synthesizing research, analyzing data, generating documents, and managing versions. By Chapter 13, you combine everything to build your own AI Employee.

## The Progressive Arc

Each chapter solves a real-world problem while explicitly applying the Seven Principles from Chapter 6.

## Two Interfaces, One Agent

Throughout this part, you'll use your General Agent through two interfaces:

- **Code** (Claude Code): For precise operations — file processing, data analysis, version control, automation scripts
- **Cowork** (Claude Desktop): For iterative work — research synthesis, document generation, planning strategies

Each chapter specifies which interface suits the problem. By Chapter 12, you'll fluidly switch between both.

## A Note on Mindset

The most important thing you'll develop in this part isn't tool proficiency — it's the ability to decompose real problems into agent-solvable tasks.

Each chapter starts with a problem you recognize from your own work. The solution always follows the same pattern:

1. **Describe** what you need (not how to do it)
2. **Verify** the agent understood correctly
3. **Execute** in small, reversible steps
4. **Persist** the output for future reuse

This is the General Agent workflow. By Chapter 13, it will be second nature.
