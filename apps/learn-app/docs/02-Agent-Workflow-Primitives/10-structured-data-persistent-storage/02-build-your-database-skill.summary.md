### Core Concept
Prove persistence in under 5 minutes with a two-script test, then capture the workflow as a reusable skill scaffold.

### Continuity Bridge
From diagnosing CSV limitations (L0) to proving the database alternative actually works across process boundaries.

### Key Mental Models
- Persistence means data outlives the process that created it.
- Two separate processes, one shared database file on disk.
- Skill file is an execution interface, not notes -- decision logic and guardrails are mandatory.

### Critical Patterns
- `write_once.py` + `read_later.py` persistence drill across separate processes.
- Lean SKILL.md scaffold: Persona, When to Use, Decision Logic, Guardrails.
- Skill grows across lessons (L1-L8) as new patterns are added.

### Common Mistake
Jumping to Neon cloud setup before proving basic local persistence. Also: keeping patterns in your head instead of capturing them in a skill file.
