### Core Concept
Practice exercises put chapter skills under independent pressure with evidence-based assessment. Claim nothing, prove everything.

### Continuity Bridge
From capstone integration (L8) to independent skill demonstration without hand-holding.

### Key Mental Models
- Evidence artifacts (DECISIONS.md, EVIDENCE.md) over verbal claims.
- Core track = baseline mastery; Challenge track = production judgment.
- Getting stuck is not failure; quitting is.

### Critical Patterns
- Core 1: Model integrity build with constraints and FK.
- Core 2: CRUD reliability with rollback proof.
- Core 3: Relationship query debug (fix broken code).
- Core 4: Transaction + Neon ops drill.
- Challenge A/B/C: Verification gate, CSV migration, incident recovery.
- Collapsible hints per exercise for when students get stuck.

### Common Mistake
Rushing through exercises without collecting evidence. Complete evidence for half the exercises beats incomplete evidence for all of them.
