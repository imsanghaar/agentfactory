  key_points:
    - "The shift from 'solve the problem' to 'solve the category of problems' via script generation is the central concept — one-time commands vs reusable automation"
    - "Preview-before-action is distinct from the dry-run in Lesson 3: here you see the actual rename mapping (old name → new name) before committing"
    - "'Fix the rule, not the file' is the batch operations mindset — every edge case fixed in the script is an edge case that never recurs"
    - "Scripts serve double duty as automation AND documentation — the naming logic is preserved in code, not just memory"
  misconceptions:
    - "Students think the preview step is optional overhead — the date-stripping mistake (losing when screenshots were taken) shows that preview caught a design error, not just a technical one"
    - "Students may think naming collisions are rare edge cases — files from different folders with identical timestamps are surprisingly common when merging sources"
    - "Students confuse 'the agent created a script' with 'I know how to write scripts' — the skill here is directing the agent to produce reusable automation, not scripting itself"
  discussion_prompts:
    - "The agent's first naming pattern (screenshot-001.png) threw away the dates. Why is 'losing information during renaming' a common pitfall, and how does the preview step prevent it?"
    - "When a batch rename fails on 7 of 87 files, why is it better to fix the script and rerun than to rename those 7 files manually?"
    - "What other repetitive tasks in your daily work could become reusable scripts if you asked an agent to create them?"
  teaching_tips:
    - "Start by asking students how long it would take to rename 87 files manually — the 43 minutes vs 30 seconds comparison makes the value of batch operations visceral"
    - "The progressive pattern table (Lessons 1-4) on the board shows how each lesson adds a new capability — have students trace the progression"
    - "Demonstrate the naming collision scenario live if possible — it surprises students how easily data loss happens with batch renames"
    - "Emphasize that 'Create a script I can reuse' is a phrase students should memorize — it transforms any one-time agent task into permanent automation"
  assessment_quick_check:
    - "Ask students to state the two key requests from this lesson: 'Show me what you'll do before doing it' and 'Create a script I can reuse'"
    - "Present a batch rename scenario where 3 files would collide. Ask: what should the agent do before proceeding?"
    - "Ask: 'Why is a script more valuable than the renamed files?' — tests understanding that automation outlasts any single operation"

# Batch Operations Workflow

You've got 87 screenshots. Renaming them one by one would take 43 minutes. Renaming them with a script takes 30 seconds.

But the real difference isn't speed.

You asked the agent to rename your screenshots. It gave you renamed screenshots AND a script called `rename-screenshots.sh`. You didn't ask for the script. The agent anticipated that you'd need to do this again next month and solved beyond your request. That's the pattern this lesson teaches: don't just solve the problem — solve the _category_ of problems.

Your screenshots are named things like `Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 10.23.45.png`. The auto-generated names made sense to your operating system. They make no sense to you. Let's fix that — and make sure the fix is permanent.

---

## The Conversation

Open Claude Code. Describe the problem.

```
You: I have lots of screenshots with ugly names like 'Screenshot 2024-01-15
at 10.23.45.png'. Help me rename them to something organized like
'screenshot-001.png', 'screenshot-002.png', etc.
```

Watch what Claude Code does.

```
Claude Code: I'll analyze your screenshots and prepare a rename plan.
Let me first see what we're working with.

[Runs: ls ~/Screenshots/*.png | head -10]
[Runs: ls ~/Screenshots/*.png | wc -l]

I found 87 screenshots. Before I rename anything, here's what I'll do:

| Current Name                              | New Name           |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 10.23.45.png     | screenshot-001.png |
| Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 14.30.22.png     | screenshot-002.png |
| Screenshot 2024-02-03 at 09.15.11.png     | screenshot-003.png |
| Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 16.42.08.png     | screenshot-004.png |
| ... (83 more files)                       | ...                |

The files will be numbered in chronological order based on
their creation date.

Should I proceed with this plan, or would you like a different
naming pattern?
```

You look at the preview. Something's wrong. The agent threw away useful information — the dates. `screenshot-001.png` tells you nothing about *when* the screenshot was taken. Six months from now, you'll have no idea what `screenshot-047.png` contains or why you took it.

```
You: Actually, include the date. Make it 'screenshot-2024-01-15-001.png'
so I can see when each screenshot was taken.
```

```
Claude Code: Good thinking. Keeping the date makes files easier to find later.
Here's the updated plan:

| Current Name                              | New Name                      |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 10.23.45.png     | screenshot-2024-01-15-001.png |
| Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 14.30.22.png     | screenshot-2024-01-15-002.png |
| Screenshot 2024-02-03 at 09.15.11.png     | screenshot-2024-02-03-001.png |
| Screenshot 2024-02-14 at 16.42.08.png     | screenshot-2024-02-14-001.png |
| ... (83 more files)                       | ...                           |

Notice that files from the same day get sequential numbers within
that day (001, 002, etc.).

I'll also create a reusable script so you can run this pattern
on new screenshots later.

Proceed?
```

You're satisfied. You give the go-ahead.

```
You: Yes, do it.
```

```
Claude Code:
[Runs: mkdir -p ~/Screenshots/renamed]
[Runs: # Rename loop with logging...]

Done. Here's what happened:

SUMMARY
- Files renamed: 87
- New location: ~/Screenshots/renamed/
- Script created: rename-screenshots.sh

CHANGE LOG (first 10):
  Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 10.23.45.png → screenshot-2024-01-15-001.png
  Screenshot 2024-01-15 at 14.30.22.png → screenshot-2024-01-15-002.png
  Screenshot 2024-02-03 at 09.15.11.png → screenshot-2024-02-03-001.png
  ...

The full log is saved in rename-log.txt.

To rename future screenshots, run:
  ./rename-screenshots.sh ~/Screenshots
```

87 files renamed. A reusable script created. A log of every change. You did this by having a conversation.

## When Batch Operations Go Sideways

The smooth version above is what happens when everything works. Here's what happens when it doesn't.

### Scenario: Naming Collision

You run the script and the agent reports:

```
Claude Code: Warning: Two files would both become
"screenshot-2024-03-15-001.png" because they were
created within the same second.

Conflicting files:
  Screenshot 2024-03-15 at 09.00.00.png (from Downloads)
  Screenshot 2024-03-15 at 09.00.00.png (from Desktop)

Options:
1. Add time to the name: screenshot-2024-03-15-0900-001.png
2. Add a suffix: screenshot-2024-03-15-001a.png and 001b.png
3. Skip the conflict and let me handle it manually

Which approach?
```

Why this matters: Batch operations that assume unique names will silently overwrite files. Good agents detect conflicts before they cause data loss. When you see this pattern, it means the agent detected a potential data loss scenario before it happened.

### Scenario: Partial Failure

The script processes 80 of 87 files, then:

```
Claude Code: Error on file 81: "Screenshot 2024-04-01 at ?.??.??.png"
The filename contains question marks that can't be parsed.

Progress: 80 of 87 renamed successfully.
Failed: 7 files with non-standard characters in filenames.

The 80 successful renames are in ~/Screenshots/renamed/.
The 7 failed files are still in the original location.

Want me to show you the failed files so we can handle them individually?
```

What you should do: Don't panic. The agent left failed files untouched (the originals are safe). Handle the exceptions individually. Then update the script to handle unusual characters in future runs.

This is why the preview step matters. If you'd caught the question-mark filenames in the preview, you could have handled them before the batch run.

### Don't Fix the File — Fix the Rule

This is the central lesson of batch operations. When something goes wrong, resist the urge to fix the affected files and move on. Fix the _rule_ that caused the error.

The rename script choked on filenames with question marks? Don't rename those 7 files manually — update `rename-screenshots.sh` to handle special characters, then rerun it on the failed files. The naming collision? Don't move two files by hand — update the script to detect same-second conflicts.

Every edge case you fix in the script is an edge case that never bites you again. Every error makes the system smarter. This is how one-time solutions evolve into robust automation.

The agent didn't just rename files. It created a _script_. That's the difference between solving a problem once and solving a category of problems. Next month when you have 50 new screenshots, you run `./rename-screenshots.sh` and they're all named consistently.

---

## The Pattern

Here's what made this work:

```
"Show me what you'll do before doing it."
```

This single request triggers the preview-before-action pattern. The agent will:

1. Analyze the current state
2. Generate a proposed plan
3. Show you the plan
4. Wait for approval

And the second key request:

```
"Create a script I can reuse for this."
```

This triggers script generation instead of one-time execution. The agent produces:

1. A working script file
2. Instructions for running it
3. Built-in logging

Together, these patterns transform tedious manual work into reviewed, logged, reusable automation.

---

## Why Scripts Matter

Consider the difference:

| Approach          | What You Get                            | Next Time               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| One-time commands | Files renamed                           | Start over from scratch |
| Script generation | Files renamed + `rename-screenshots.sh` | Run one command         |

The first approach solves the problem. The second approach solves the _category_ of problems. Code becomes the interface between your intent and recurring tasks.

The script also serves as documentation. Six months from now, you might forget exactly how you wanted screenshots named. Open `rename-screenshots.sh` and the logic is right there, preserved in code.

## The Key Requests

Remember these phrases for batch operations:

| What You Want      | What to Say                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| See the plan first | "Show me what you'll do before doing it"  |
| Get reusable code  | "Create a script I can reuse for this"    |
| Keep a record      | "Log every change you make"               |
| Change the plan    | "Actually, make it [new pattern] instead" |
| Limit scope        | "Just do the first 5 files to test"       |

You're not memorizing bash syntax. You're learning how to direct an agent effectively.

## What You're Building

By now in this chapter, you've learned:

| Lesson                   | Pattern                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1. First Workflow        | "Help me understand"                 |
| 2. Safety First          | "Back up before changing"            |
| 3. Categorize with Rules | "Write rules first"                  |
| **4. Batch Operations**  | **"Show me first, create a script"** |

Each pattern builds on the last. You understand your files. You protect them with backups. You document your rules. Now you transform repetitive tasks into reusable automation.

Your scripts are powerful. They rename 87 files in seconds. But what happens when a script does the WRONG thing to 87 files in seconds? Speed amplifies mistakes exactly as much as it amplifies productivity. You need a recovery workflow that works as fast as the scripts that caused the problem.

## Try With AI: Extended Practice

**Prompt 1: Complex Naming Patterns**

```
I want to rename my screenshots but the pattern is more complex:
- Group by month into folders (2024-01/, 2024-02/, etc.)
- Within each folder, name files screenshot-001.png, screenshot-002.png
- Show me the folder structure and file mapping before doing anything

Can you handle this multi-step organization?
```

**What you're practicing:** Compound requests. You're asking the agent to both reorganize (create folders) and rename (change filenames). Watch how it breaks down the complex task.

**Prompt 2: Dry Run Mode**

```
I want to see exactly what commands you would run to rename these files,
but don't actually run them yet. Show me the bash commands you'd execute
so I can understand what's happening.
```

**What you're practicing:** Understanding the mechanics. By asking to see the commands without execution, you learn what's happening "under the hood" while staying in control.

**Prompt 3: Content-Aware Operations**

```
I have 200 PDF invoices named "Invoice_12345.pdf". I want to rename them
to include the client name, but the client name is INSIDE the PDF, not in
the filename. Can you extract it and use it in the rename?
```

**What you're practicing:** Content-aware batch operations. You're moving beyond filename-based operations to using file contents as input. This is how real automation handles documents where the metadata you need is inside the file, not in its name.
