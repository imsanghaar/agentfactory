This lesson provides 13 hands-on exercises across 5 modules plus capstone projects, bridging the gap between understanding file processing workflows and executing them fluently. Three core skills are practiced throughout: **file workflow execution** (applying survey, backup, organization, batch, recovery, and search workflows), **systematic debugging** (diagnosing errors in inventories, backups, rules, and scripts), and **pipeline design** (combining workflows into end-to-end systems). Every exercise uses the seven-step File Processing Framework: Survey, Backup, Plan, Test, Execute, Verify, Document.

The modules progress from foundational investigation (Module 1: File Investigation) through safety practices (Module 2: Safety-First Backup), rule design (Module 3: Organization Rules), automation (Module 4: Batch Operations), and recovery skills (Module 5: Recovery & Search), culminating in three capstone projects that synthesize all workflows. Early modules provide starter and better prompts to scaffold learning; later modules remove prompts so students design their own approaches.

Students assess their work using a five-criteria rubric covering investigation quality, safety practices, workflow execution, problem diagnosis, and documentation. These exercises prepare students for the automated file management workflows covered in later chapters, where the patterns practiced here become the foundation for autonomous agent behavior.
