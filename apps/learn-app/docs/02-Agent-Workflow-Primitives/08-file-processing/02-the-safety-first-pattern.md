  key_points:
    - "The three-step safety cycle (backup → verify → proceed) is the foundation for EVERY destructive operation in the rest of this chapter and the book"
    - "The paradox that safety enables action, not limits it, is the core mindset shift — students who internalize this experiment more freely"
    - "Agent clarification behavior (asking 'what counts as important?') demonstrates why good agents ask before acting on ambiguous instructions"
    - "Verification is non-negotiable — a silent backup failure creates false confidence that is worse than no backup at all"
  misconceptions:
    - "Students think backups are optional overhead — the opening scenario (misplaced 1099 forms) shows how a 2-minute backup prevents a 30-minute recovery"
    - "Students assume 'backup complete' means everything worked — the permissions error and disk space scenarios show why verification must follow every backup"
    - "Students confuse the agent asking questions with the agent being uncertain — clarification before action is a safety feature, not a weakness"
  discussion_prompts:
    - "Have you ever lost a file because a move or rename went wrong? What would the safety-first pattern have changed about that experience?"
    - "The lesson says 'the 2 minutes on backup save 20 minutes of anxiety.' Can you think of other areas in your work where a small upfront cost eliminates ongoing stress?"
    - "Why is a 'mostly complete' backup (134 of 136 files) potentially more dangerous than no backup at all?"
  teaching_tips:
    - "Start with the opening disaster scenario (misplaced tax documents) — it is visceral and every student has experienced a version of this"
    - "The domain extension table (files, code, databases, system config) is a strong whiteboard moment — have students add their own domain examples"
    - "Make sure students actually complete the checkpoint before moving on — Lesson 5 deliberately uses the backup created here for recovery practice"
    - "Emphasize that the agent ASKED what 'important' meant rather than assuming — this is a safety behavior students should expect and encourage"
  assessment_quick_check:
    - "Ask students to recite the three-step safety cycle from memory: backup, verify, then proceed"
    - "Present a scenario: 'You want to reorganize 500 photos.' Ask students what their first prompt to the agent should be"
    - "Ask: 'Why should you verify a backup even if the agent says it succeeded?' — tests understanding of silent failures"

# The Safety-First Pattern

Here's what happens when you skip the backup.

You ask the agent to organize your Downloads folder. It moves 400 files into categories. Clean, fast, satisfying. Then you notice: your tax documents aren't in the `documents/` folder. They're not in `spreadsheets/` either. You check `misc/`. Not there. You check the original Downloads folder. It's empty — the agent moved everything out.

Your 1099 forms are gone. Not deleted — *misplaced*. They're sitting in a folder called `archives/` because the agent categorized `.pdf` files older than a year as "archival." You didn't know that rule existed. You didn't ask. And now you're spending 30 minutes hunting through subfolders for documents your accountant needs by Friday.

That's the *good* outcome. The bad outcome is a naming collision: two files called `report.pdf` from different folders, and the agent overwrites one with the other. The bad outcome is a permissions error halfway through a batch move that leaves 200 files in limbo — half moved, half not, and you can't remember which were where.

This lesson exists because of that gap between "the agent did what I asked" and "the agent did what I *meant*."

> **The paradox:** The backup constraint doesn't limit you. It frees you. Every safety rule you think slows you down actually speeds you up. Without a safety net, you hesitate at every step. With one, you experiment without fear. The 2 minutes you spend on backup save the 20 minutes of anxiety that would otherwise paralyze every decision.

In the next 20 minutes, you'll direct Claude Code to create a backup, verify it's complete, and only then proceed. This pattern applies far beyond files — code changes, data transformations, system configurations — any workflow where mistakes have consequences.

## The Conversation

You're ready to organize your Downloads folder, but you're nervous about losing something important. Here's how to direct Claude Code to establish safety first.

### You Start With Safety

**You:**

> Before we make any changes to my Downloads folder, I want a backup of important files. Can you help me create one?

**Claude Code:**

> Good thinking. Creating a backup before making changes is the safest approach. Before I create the backup, I need to understand what counts as "important" for you.
>
> I can backup:
>
> - **All files** (complete safety, largest backup)
> - **Files modified in the last N days** (recent work you're actively using)
> - **Specific file types** (PDFs, documents, spreadsheets — common important formats)
> - **A custom selection** (you tell me exactly what matters)
>
> Which approach works best for you?

### You Define What Matters

Notice what just happened. The agent didn't assume what you wanted. It asked. This is critical. Different people have different definitions of "important." A photographer cares about images. An accountant cares about spreadsheets. A researcher cares about PDFs.

**You:**

> Let's backup all PDFs and any file modified in the last 30 days.

**Claude Code:**

> That's a good combination. PDFs often contain important documents, and anything modified recently is likely something you're actively working with.
>
> I'll create a timestamped backup folder and copy those files. Here's what I'm going to do:
>
> 1. Create `backup/downloads-backup-2026-02-12/` in your workspace
> 2. Copy all `.pdf` files from Downloads
> 3. Copy all files modified in the last 30 days
> 4. Report what was backed up
>
> Creating backup now...
>
> ```
> Created: backup/downloads-backup-2026-02-12/
> Copied: 47 PDF files (12.3 MB)
> Copied: 89 recently modified files (156.2 MB)
> Total: 136 files backed up (168.5 MB)
> ```
>
> Backup complete. Want me to verify it's complete before we proceed?

### You Verify the Backup

**You:**

> Yes, verify the backup is complete.

**Claude Code:**

> Comparing source and backup...
>
> ```
> PDF files in Downloads:     47
> PDF files in backup:        47 ✓
>
> Recent files in Downloads:  89
> Recent files in backup:     89 ✓
>
> All files successfully backed up.
> ```
>
> The backup matches the source. You now have a complete copy of your important files. If anything goes wrong during organization, you can restore from `backup/downloads-backup-2026-02-12/`.

## Three Things to Notice

**1. The agent asked what "important" meant.** You said "backup important files." A dangerous agent would have assumed "everything" and started copying 12 GB. This agent asked: "What counts as important?" That single question — clarifying before acting — is the difference between a helpful tool and a dangerous one. The agent ASKED before acting. A dangerous agent would have assumed.

**2. You verified, not just trusted.** The agent could have said "Done!" after copying. Instead, you directed it to compare counts: 47 PDFs in source, 47 in backup. Numbers match. Backup complete. Trust, but verify — always.

**3. The order was the whole point.** Backup → Verify → Then make changes. Not the other way around. The backup *enables* the changes that follow.

---

## When the Backup Itself Goes Wrong

Here's something textbooks usually skip. Sometimes the backup doesn't work perfectly.

### Scenario: Permissions Error

You ask the agent to backup your Downloads folder, and it reports:

```
Claude Code: Backup in progress...

cp: cannot open '/Users/you/Downloads/restricted-report.pdf'
  for reading: Permission denied

Copied: 134 of 136 files
Failed: 2 files (permission errors)
```

What happened? Some files have restrictive permissions. The agent couldn't read them.

What you should say:

```
You: Two files failed. Can you show me which ones and fix
the permissions so we can back them up?
```

The agent will use `chmod` to adjust permissions or `sudo` if needed. The key lesson: **check for errors in the backup output**. A "mostly complete" backup can give false confidence.

### Scenario: Disk Space

You ask for a full backup of a 50 GB folder, and:

```
Claude Code: Your backup destination only has 12 GB of free space.
A full backup would require approximately 50 GB.

Options:
1. Backup only recent files (estimated 8 GB)
2. Backup only documents, not media (estimated 3 GB)
3. Use a different destination with more space
4. Compress the backup (slower but smaller)

Which approach would you prefer?
```

The agent caught the problem BEFORE running out of space mid-backup. This is why good agents check preconditions.

---

## The Pattern

Here's the pattern you just learned, expressed as a reusable template:

### Before Any Destructive Operation

```
"Before [making changes / reorganizing / deleting / moving],
create a backup of [what matters to me]."
```

Examples:

- "Before reorganizing my Downloads, create a backup of all documents."
- "Before deleting old files, create a backup of anything from the last year."
- "Before renaming my photo folders, create a backup of the entire Photos directory."

### After the Backup

```
"Verify the backup is complete. Show me any errors."
```

This step is non-negotiable. A backup that fails silently is worse than no backup. It gives false confidence.

### Only Then Proceed

```
"Now we can [make the changes]."
```

With verified backup in place, you can proceed with confidence.

## The Safety-First Mindset

This pattern extends beyond file organization. It's a universal safety mindset:

| Domain                   | Safety-First Pattern              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **File organization**    | Backup before moving files        |
| **Code changes**         | Commit before refactoring         |
| **Database updates**     | Export before modifying            |
| **System configuration** | Snapshot before changing settings  |

The common thread: **create a reversible state before any irreversible action**.

---

## What Your Backup Enables

Your backup directory is now a safety net. Here's what it enables for the rest of this chapter:

| Scenario                      | Recovery              |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Script miscategorizes files   | Restore from backup   |
| Accidentally delete something | Copy back from backup |
| Want to try different rules   | Reset and experiment  |
| Organization goes wrong       | Start fresh           |

In Lesson 5, you'll deliberately make a mistake and practice recovery. The backup you created now makes that learning safe.

## ✅ Checkpoint: Do This Now

Stop reading. Open Claude Code and create a backup of your Downloads folder (or whichever folder you surveyed in Lesson 1).

Use this prompt:

```
Before we make any changes to my [Downloads/Documents/Desktop] folder,
create a timestamped backup of all PDFs and any file modified in the
last 30 days. Put it in file-organizer/backup/ and verify the backup
is complete. Show me any errors.
```

You should now have:

- `file-organizer/backup/` with a timestamped subfolder
- A verification report confirming the backup is complete

**Don't move to Lesson 3 until your backup is verified.** Everything that follows assumes you have a safety net.

## Try With AI: Extended Practice

**Prompt 1: Selective Backup Strategy**

```
I want to backup my Documents folder, but it's 50GB. Help me create
a smarter backup that only includes:
- Files modified in the last 90 days
- Any file larger than 10MB (probably important)
- All PDFs regardless of date

Show me what this would capture before creating the backup.
```

**What you're practicing:** Compound backup criteria. You're learning to combine multiple filters (date, size, type) to create targeted backups instead of copying everything.

**Prompt 2: Backup Verification Deep Dive**

```
I have a backup folder from last week. Help me verify it's still valid:
- Are all the source files still in the backup?
- Did any source files change since the backup?
- Are there files in the backup that no longer exist in the source?

Give me a complete integrity report.
```

**What you're practicing:** Backup auditing. Real backups can become stale. You're learning to direct the agent to perform comprehensive verification, not just count files.

**Prompt 3: Recovery Rehearsal**

```
Pretend I accidentally deleted an important file called "budget-2025.xlsx"
from my Documents folder. Walk me through exactly how I would recover it
from my backup. Show me the commands but don't actually run them yet.
```

**What you're practicing:** Recovery planning. The best time to learn recovery is before you need it. You're practicing the restore workflow in a safe, hypothetical scenario.

## Key Takeaways

**Safety enables action.** The backup constraint doesn't limit you. It frees you to experiment without fear.

**Verification is non-negotiable.** A backup that might have failed is worse than no backup. Always confirm completeness. Always ask for error reports.

**This pattern is universal.** Backup-before-change applies to files, code, databases, and any system where actions might be irreversible.

Your files are backed up. You can experiment without fear. But here's the question that matters now: which files should live together? A PDF named "Q4-Budget-Draft.pdf" — is that a financial document or a Q4 project file? Your backup makes the answer cheap to get wrong. So how do you design rules that handle ambiguity?
