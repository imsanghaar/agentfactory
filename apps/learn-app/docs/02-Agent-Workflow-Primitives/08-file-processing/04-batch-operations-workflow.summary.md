### Core Concept

Principle 2 (Code as Universal Interface) means transforming one-time solutions into permanent automation. Request a reusable script, not a one-time execution.

### Key Mental Models

- **Preview before action**: Always ask to see what will change before the agent executes. This prevents mistakes and builds trust.
- **Scripts over commands**: One-time execution solves today's problem. Scripts solve the category of problems forever.
- **Iterative refinement**: See the preview. Adjust the pattern. Approve. The agent adapts to your feedback.
- **Fix the rule, not the file**: When batch operations fail, update the script to handle the edge case — don't just fix the affected files manually. The script gets smarter each time it fails.

### Critical Patterns

- **"Show me what you'll do before doing it"**: Triggers the preview-before-action safety pattern.
- **"Create a script I can reuse for this"**: Transforms a manual task into permanent automation.
- **Principle 2 (Code as Interface)**: The agent produces runnable code you can execute again next month.
- **Principle 3 (Verification)**: Preview, approve, execute, and log creates a verification chain.

### Common Mistakes

- Letting the agent execute without preview: You lose the chance to refine the approach before mistakes happen.
- Not requesting a script: You'll need to repeat the conversation next time you face the same problem.
- Forgetting that you can iterate: See the preview, ask for changes, see the updated preview, then approve.
