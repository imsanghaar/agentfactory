# Chapter 79: Voice AI Fundamentals

Build mental models before building systems. This chapter creates a `voice-foundations` skill covering architectures, latency targets, and the modern voice stack.

---

## Goals

- Understand the voice AI landscape (frameworks vs. direct APIs)
- Map the STT → LLM → TTS pipeline and latency budgets
- Learn transport options (WebRTC, WebSockets, HTTP streaming)
- Capture fundamentals in a reusable voice foundations skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Voice landscape and use cases
- Latency budgets and quality targets
- Architecture options: frameworks vs. raw APIs
- Capstone: documented voice foundations skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a concise voice fundamentals skill that informs all later implementation chapters.

---

## Prerequisites

- Parts 6-9 (agent APIs, deployment, TypeScript async patterns)
