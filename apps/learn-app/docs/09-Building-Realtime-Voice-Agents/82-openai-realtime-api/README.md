# Chapter 82: OpenAI Realtime API

Use OpenAI’s native speech-to-speech API directly. This chapter builds a `openai-realtime` skill for WebRTC connections, function calling, barge-in, and low-latency handling.

---

## Goals

- Connect to the OpenAI Realtime API via WebRTC
- Handle speech-to-speech with function calling and interruption
- Manage latency budgets and cost expectations
- Capture reusable snippets/configs in a realtime skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Build the realtime skill
- WebRTC connection patterns and function calling
- Interruption/barge-in handling
- Capstone: realtime voice demo; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a working realtime integration and a reusable skill for OpenAI’s voice API.
