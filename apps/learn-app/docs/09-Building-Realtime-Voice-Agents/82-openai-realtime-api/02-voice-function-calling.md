# Function Calling in Voice

The Realtime API does not just speak—it acts. Through function calling, your voice agent executes real operations: creating tasks, querying databases, sending notifications. But voice-triggered actions require different UX patterns than chat-based tools.

This lesson teaches you to implement voice functions that feel natural: filler speech during async operations, confirmation for destructive actions, and graceful error recovery.

---

## Voice Function Calling: The Difference

In chat interfaces, tool calls are invisible—users wait for a response. In voice, silence is awkward. A 3-second database query in chat is fine. A 3-second silence in voice feels broken.

### Chat Tool Call

```
User: "Create a task to review the proposal"
[2 second wait - acceptable]
Agent: "I've created your task."
```

### Voice Tool Call (Wrong)

```
User: "Create a task to review the proposal"
[2 seconds of silence - feels broken]
Agent: "I've created your task."
```

### Voice Tool Call (Right)

```
User: "Create a task to review the proposal"
Agent: "Creating that task for you..."
[function executes]
Agent: "Done. I've added 'review the proposal' to your task list."
```

**The pattern**: Fill silence with acknowledgment. Confirm completion with results.

---

## Defining Voice Functions

Function definitions for the Realtime API follow the OpenAI function calling schema, but require voice-specific considerations.

### Basic Function Schema

```python
task_functions = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "create_task",
        "description": "Create a new task for the user. Use when the user asks to add, create, or make a new task.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "title": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The task title. Extract the core action from the user's request."
                },
                "due_date": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "When the task is due, in YYYY-MM-DD format. Parse natural language like 'tomorrow', 'next Friday', 'end of week'."
                },
                "priority": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["low", "medium", "high"],
                    "description": "Task priority. Default to 'medium' if not specified."
                }
            },
            "required": ["title"]
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "list_tasks",
        "description": "List the user's tasks. Use when user asks what tasks they have, what's on their list, or what's due.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "status": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["all", "pending", "completed", "overdue"],
                    "description": "Which tasks to show. Default to 'pending' if not specified."
                },
                "due_filter": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["today", "tomorrow", "this_week", "all"],
                    "description": "Filter by due date. Default to 'all' if not specified."
                }
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "complete_task",
        "description": "Mark a task as complete. Use when user says they finished, completed, or done with a task.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "task_identifier": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "How the user referred to the task. Could be title, number, or description."
                }
            },
            "required": ["task_identifier"]
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "name": "delete_task",
        "description": "Permanently delete a task. This is destructive and cannot be undone. Requires confirmation.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "task_identifier": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "How the user referred to the task to delete."
                },
                "confirmed": {
                    "type": "boolean",
                    "description": "Whether the user has confirmed deletion. Must be true to proceed."
                }
            },
            "required": ["task_identifier", "confirmed"]
        }
    }
]
```

### Voice-Specific Description Guidelines

| Guideline | Why | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Include trigger phrases | Model knows when to call | "Use when user asks to add, create, or make..." |
| Mention defaults | Reduces clarification requests | "Default to 'medium' if not specified" |
| Flag destructive actions | Enables confirmation logic | "This is destructive and cannot be undone" |
| Describe natural language parsing | Improves extraction | "Parse natural language like 'tomorrow', 'next Friday'" |

## Registering Functions with the Session

Functions are registered during session configuration:

```python
def send_session_config(data_channel, instructions: str, functions: list):
    """Configure session with voice functions."""

    config = {
        "type": "session.update",
        "session": {
            "instructions": f"""
            {instructions}

            When using tools:
            - Acknowledge the request before calling the function
            - Provide brief filler while waiting ("Let me check that...")
            - Confirm results clearly and concisely
            - If an error occurs, explain what happened and suggest next steps
            """,

            "tools": functions,

            "turn_detection": {
                "type": "server_vad",
                "threshold": 0.5,
                "silence_duration_ms": 500
            },

            "input_audio_format": "pcm16",
            "output_audio_format": "pcm16"
        }
    }

    data_channel.send(json.dumps(config))
```

---

## Handling Function Calls

When the model decides to call a function, you receive events through the DataChannel:

### Function Call Event Flow

```
Model decides to call function
    │
    ├── response.function_call_arguments.delta (streaming arguments)
    │
    ├── response.function_call_arguments.done (arguments complete)
    │
    └── You execute function and send result
```

### Implementation

```python
class FunctionHandler:
    """Handles voice function calls."""

    def __init__(self, data_channel, task_service):
        self.data_channel = data_channel
        self.task_service = task_service
        self.pending_calls = {}  # call_id -> accumulated arguments

    async def handle_event(self, event: dict):
        """Process function-related events."""
        event_type = event.get("type")

        if event_type == "response.function_call_arguments.delta":
            # Accumulate streaming arguments
            call_id = event["call_id"]
            delta = event.get("delta", "")

            if call_id not in self.pending_calls:
                self.pending_calls[call_id] = {
                    "name": event["name"],
                    "arguments": ""
                }
            self.pending_calls[call_id]["arguments"] += delta

        elif event_type == "response.function_call_arguments.done":
            # Arguments complete, execute function
            call_id = event["call_id"]
            call_info = self.pending_calls.pop(call_id, None)

            if call_info:
                result = await self._execute_function(
                    call_info["name"],
                    json.loads(call_info["arguments"])
                )
                self._send_result(call_id, result)

    async def _execute_function(self, name: str, args: dict) -> dict:
        """Execute the function and return result."""
        print(f"[function] Executing {name} with {args}")

        try:
            if name == "create_task":
                task = await self.task_service.create(
                    title=args["title"],
                    due_date=args.get("due_date"),
                    priority=args.get("priority", "medium")
                )
                return {
                    "success": True,
                    "message": f"Created task: {task.title}",
                    "task_id": task.id,
                    "due_date": task.due_date
                }

            elif name == "list_tasks":
                tasks = await self.task_service.list(
                    status=args.get("status", "pending"),
                    due_filter=args.get("due_filter", "all")
                )
                return {
                    "success": True,
                    "count": len(tasks),
                    "tasks": [
                        {"title": t.title, "due": t.due_date, "priority": t.priority}
                        for t in tasks
                    ]
                }

            elif name == "complete_task":
                task = await self.task_service.complete(args["task_identifier"])
                return {

                    "message": f"Completed: {task.title}"
                }

            elif name == "delete_task":
                if not args.get("confirmed"):
                    return {
                        "success": False,
                        "needs_confirmation": True,
                        "message": "Deletion requires confirmation. Ask user to confirm."
                    }

                await self.task_service.delete(args["task_identifier"])
                return {
                    "success": True,
                    "message": "Task deleted permanently"
                }

            else:
                return {"success": False, "error": f"Unknown function: {name}"}

        except Exception as e:
            return {
                "success": False,
                "error": str(e),
                "suggestion": "Please try again or rephrase your request."
            }

    def _send_result(self, call_id: str, result: dict):
        """Send function result back to the model."""
        response = {
            "type": "conversation.item.create",
            "item": {
                "type": "function_call_output",
                "call_id": call_id,
                "output": json.dumps(result)
            }

        # Trigger response generation
        self.data_channel.send(json.dumps({"type": "response.create"}))
```

**Output:**
```
[function] Executing create_task with {'title': 'review proposal', 'due_date': '2025-01-03'}
[realtime] Function result sent
[agent] Done. I've created a task to review the proposal, due on Friday.
```

## Filler Speech Patterns

Users expect feedback during async operations. The model can generate filler speech before executing functions.

### Instructing the Model for Filler

Include filler guidance in your instructions:

```python
instructions = """
You are a voice assistant for Task Manager.

**Before calling any function:**
1. Acknowledge the request naturally: "Sure, I'll do that" or "Let me check"
2. For operations that might take time, add brief filler: "One moment..."

**After function results:**
1. Summarize the result concisely
2. If there are multiple items, list the top 3 and mention the total
3. Offer next steps: "Would you like to add another?" or "Anything else?"

**Filler examples:**
- Creating task: "Sure, creating that task for you..."
- Listing tasks: "Let me pull up your tasks..."
- Completing task: "Marking that as done..."
- Error: "Hmm, I ran into an issue..."
"""
```

### Filler Timing

The model generates filler before the function call event:

```
User: "What tasks do I have today?"
                │
                ▼
Model generates filler: "Let me check your tasks for today..."
                │
                ▼
Function call event: list_tasks(due_filter="today")
                │
                ▼
Your code executes function (may take 500ms)
                │
                ▼
Send result to model
                │
                ▼
Model generates response: "You have 3 tasks today: review proposal,
                          send invoices, and team standup."
```

The user hears filler immediately, then the result—no awkward silence.

### Custom Filler for Long Operations

For operations exceeding 2-3 seconds, consider multi-stage filler:

```python
async def execute_with_progress(self, name: str, args: dict):
    """Execute function with progress updates."""

    # Stage 1: Immediate acknowledgment (model-generated)
    # Already handled by instructions

    # Stage 2: If operation is slow, send interim status
    operation = asyncio.create_task(self._execute_function(name, args))

    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Wait 2 seconds

    if not operation.done():
        # Send interim status through DataChannel
        self._speak("Still working on that, almost there...")

    return await operation

def _speak(self, text: str):
    """Make the model speak specific text."""
    event = {
        "type": "conversation.item.create",
        "item": {
            "type": "message",
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": [{"type": "text", "text": text}]
        }
    }
    self.data_channel.send(json.dumps(event))
    self.data_channel.send(json.dumps({"type": "response.create"}))
```

---

## Confirmation Patterns for Destructive Actions

Not all actions should execute immediately. Destructive operations need confirmation.

### Identifying Destructive Actions

| Action | Destructive? | Why |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Create task | No | Easily undone |
| Complete task | Maybe | Could revert, but context-dependent |
| Delete task | **Yes** | Permanent data loss |
| Clear all tasks | **Yes** | Massive data loss |
| Send email | **Yes** | Cannot unsend |
| Cancel subscription | **Yes** | May have consequences |

### Two-Step Confirmation Pattern

```python
# Step 1: Function called without confirmation
def handle_delete_request(self, task_identifier: str, confirmed: bool):
    if not confirmed:
        # Tell model to ask for confirmation
        return {
            "success": False,
            "needs_confirmation": True,
            "task_to_delete": task_identifier,
            "message": "Please confirm deletion by asking: 'Are you sure you want to delete this task?'"
        }

    # Step 2: User confirms, function called again with confirmed=True
    self.task_service.delete(task_identifier)
    return {"success": True, "message": "Task deleted"}
```

### Conversation Flow

```
User: "Delete the proposal review task"

Agent: "You want to delete 'review proposal'. This can't be undone.
        Should I go ahead and delete it?"

User: "Yes, delete it"

Agent: "Done. I've permanently deleted the proposal review task."
```

### Timeout for Confirmation

Confirmations should expire:

```python
class ConfirmationManager:
    """Manages pending confirmations with timeout."""

    def __init__(self, timeout_seconds: int = 30):
        self.pending = {}  # action_id -> (action_data, timestamp)
        self.timeout = timeout_seconds

    def request_confirmation(self, action_id: str, action_data: dict) -> dict:
        """Store pending confirmation."""
        self.pending[action_id] = (action_data, time.time())
        return {
            "needs_confirmation": True,
            "action_id": action_id,
            "message": f"Confirm: {action_data['description']}?"
        }

    def confirm(self, action_id: str) -> dict | None:
        """Retrieve confirmed action if still valid."""
        if action_id not in self.pending:
            return None

        action_data, timestamp = self.pending.pop(action_id)

        if time.time() - timestamp > self.timeout:
            return {
                "expired": True,
                "message": "Confirmation expired. Please try again."
            }

        return action_data

    def cleanup_expired(self):
        """Remove expired confirmations."""
        now = time.time()
        expired = [
            action_id for action_id, (_, ts) in self.pending.items()
            if now - ts > self.timeout
        ]
        for action_id in expired:
            del self.pending[action_id]
```

## Error Handling in Voice

Errors in voice context need different handling than chat:

### Error Categories

| Category | Voice Response | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **User Error** | Clarify and suggest | "I couldn't find a task called 'meeting'. Did you mean 'team meeting'?" |
| **Temporary Failure** | Apologize and retry offer | "I'm having trouble reaching the task system. Want me to try again?" |
| **Permanent Failure** | Explain and provide alternative | "I can't delete tasks right now. Try again in a few minutes, or use the app." |
| **Unknown Error** | Graceful fallback | "Something went wrong. Can you try rephrasing that?" |

### Error Response Implementation

```python
def format_error_for_voice(self, error: Exception, function_name: str) -> dict:
    """Convert error to voice-appropriate response."""

    error_str = str(error).lower()

    # User error: bad input
    if "not found" in error_str:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error_type": "not_found",
            "spoken_message": "I couldn't find that task. Could you describe it differently?",
            "suggestion": "Try using the exact task title or a unique phrase from it."
        }

    # Temporary failure: service unavailable
    if "timeout" in error_str or "connection" in error_str:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error_type": "temporary",
            "spoken_message": "I'm having trouble reaching the task system right now.",
            "suggestion": "Would you like me to try again?"
        }

    # Permission error
    if "permission" in error_str or "unauthorized" in error_str:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error_type": "permission",
            "spoken_message": "You don't have permission to do that.",
            "suggestion": "You may need to check your account settings."
        }

    # Unknown error: graceful fallback
    return {
        "success": False,
        "error_type": "unknown",
        "spoken_message": "Something went wrong with that request.",
        "suggestion": "Could you try rephrasing? Or we can try again."
    }
```

### Retry Pattern

```python
async def execute_with_retry(
    self,
    name: str,
    args: dict,
    max_retries: int = 2
) -> dict:
    """Execute function with automatic retry on temporary failures."""

    for attempt in range(max_retries + 1):
        try:
            result = await self._execute_function(name, args)

            if result.get("success"):
                return result

            # Check if retryable
            if result.get("error_type") == "temporary" and attempt < max_retries:
                await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Brief pause
                continue

            return result

        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries:
                await asyncio.sleep(1)
                continue

            return self.format_error_for_voice(e, name)

    return {
        "success": False,
        "error_type": "exhausted",
        "spoken_message": "I tried a few times but couldn't complete that. Please try again later."
    }
```

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Design Voice Functions

```
I'm building voice function calling for my Task Manager. Help me design:

1. Function schemas for: create, list, complete, delete, and reschedule tasks
2. Voice-optimized descriptions that trigger correctly
3. Parameter defaults to minimize clarification questions
4. Destructive action flags for confirmation logic

Consider edge cases:
- User says "remind me to..." (is this a task?)
- User says "I'm done with everything" (complete all?)
- User mentions time without date ("at 3pm")
```

**What you are learning**: Function design for voice context. Good schemas reduce clarification loops and improve user experience.

### Prompt 2: Implement Filler Patterns

```
My voice agent has these latency characteristics:
- create_task: 500ms average, 2s worst case
- list_tasks: 300ms average, 1s worst case
- external_api_call: 1-5 seconds

Help me design filler speech patterns:
1. What should the model say before each function type?
2. How do I handle operations that might take 5+ seconds?
3. Should filler be model-generated or code-generated?
4. How do I avoid filler for fast operations (feels patronizing)?

Provide example instructions and code.
```

**What you are learning**: UX timing patterns. Voice interfaces have stricter timing requirements than visual interfaces.

### Prompt 3: Error Recovery Flows

```
My voice agent encounters these errors. Design voice-appropriate recovery:

1. Task not found: User said "complete the meeting task" but no exact match
2. Network timeout: Database didn't respond in 3 seconds
3. Validation error: User tried to create task with due date in the past
4. Rate limit: Too many requests, need to slow down
5. Permission denied: User tried to delete someone else's task

For each:
- What should the agent say?
- What action should the agent offer?
- How do we avoid user frustration?

Consider: Users are on the phone, can't see a screen, can't easily re-type.
```

**What you are learning**: Error UX design. Voice errors need immediate, actionable guidance—users cannot see error codes or retry buttons.

## Safety Note

Function calling in voice carries unique risks:

- **Misheard commands**: "Delete all tasks" vs "Delete Paul's tasks"—implement confirmation for bulk operations
- **Unauthorized callers**: Voice does not prove identity—require PIN for sensitive operations
- **Background noise triggers**: TV says "buy ten shares"—your agent should not execute
- **Social engineering**: Caller pretends to be account owner—implement verification

Test with adversarial scenarios before production. Monitor early calls for unexpected function invocations.
