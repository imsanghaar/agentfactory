# Production Telephony Patterns

Your voice agent connects to the phone network. Users can call in, and your agent responds. But what happens when a caller says "I need to talk to someone about my invoice" instead of pressing a number? What if your call recordings violate privacy laws in your customer's jurisdiction? What if Twilio goes down during your busiest hour?

Production telephony requires patterns that go beyond basic integration. Enterprise call centers have solved these problems for decades, but the solutions—IVR systems, compliance frameworks, failover architectures—need adaptation for AI-native voice agents. The good news: modern LLM-powered intent detection makes some traditional patterns obsolete while making others more powerful.

This lesson transforms your telephony integration from demo-ready to production-grade. You'll implement natural language IVR that understands what callers want without forcing them through menu trees, configure recording with proper consent flows for global compliance, and design failover that survives provider outages. By the end, both your `voice-telephony` and `web-audio-capture` skills will be production-ready assets—genuine Digital FTE components you can deploy for customers.

## Modern IVR: Natural Language Intent Detection

### The Problem with Traditional IVR

Traditional Interactive Voice Response systems force callers through menu trees:

```
"Press 1 for billing. Press 2 for technical support. Press 3 for sales.
Press 4 to repeat these options."
```

This approach has fundamental problems:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Caller frustration** | Users hate navigating phone trees (average abandonment: 13% per menu level) |
| **Rigid routing** | Callers with mixed needs ("billing question about technical issue") don't fit categories |
| **Maintenance burden** | Every new department requires menu updates across systems |
| **Limited context** | DTMF codes carry no semantic information to downstream agents |

### Natural Language IVR Pattern

Modern voice agents replace menu trees with conversational intent detection:

```
Traditional: "Press 1 for billing, Press 2 for support..."
Modern: "Hi, I'm here to help. What can I do for you today?"
```

The pattern:

```
Caller speaks freely
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Intent Classifier  │
│  (LLM-powered)      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
   ┌─────────────┐
   │ Route by Intent │
   │   billing → Billing Agent    │
   │   technical → Tech Agent     │
   │   sales → Sales Agent        │
   │   escalation → Human         │
   └─────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Specialist Agent   │
│  (receives context) │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Implementation: Conversational IVR

Here's a complete IVR implementation that uses your voice agent for intent detection:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional, Literal
from livekit.agents import Agent, RunContext
import json

IntentType = Literal["billing", "technical", "sales", "escalation", "general"]

@dataclass
class CallerContext:
    """Accumulated context about the caller."""
    caller_id: str
    intent: Optional[IntentType]
    raw_statement: str
    sentiment: str
    extracted_entities: dict

class ConversationalIVR(Agent):
    """Natural language IVR using LLM intent detection."""

    INTENT_PROMPT = """
    Classify the caller's intent into exactly one category:

    - billing: Invoice questions, payment issues, refunds, charges, pricing disputes
    - technical: Product errors, bugs, outages, how-to questions, troubleshooting
    - sales: Upgrade interest, new features, demos, enterprise inquiries
    - escalation: Frustration, complaints, cancellation threats, manager requests
    - general: Greetings, unclear intent, unrelated questions

    Caller said: "{statement}"

    Respond with JSON:
    {{
        "intent": "billing|technical|sales|escalation|general",
        "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
        "sentiment": "positive|neutral|negative|frustrated",
        "entities": {{}}
    }}

    For entities, extract any mentioned: account_id, invoice_number,
    product_name, error_message, dates.
    """

    async def on_enter(self, ctx: RunContext):
        """Greet caller conversationally."""
        await ctx.say(

            f"One moment please."
        )

        await ctx.handoff(agent_class, context=caller_ctx)

    async def _handle_escalation(
        self,
        ctx: RunContext,
        caller_ctx: CallerContext
    ):
        """Handle frustrated callers or escalation requests."""
        if caller_ctx.sentiment == "frustrated":
            await ctx.say(
                "I'm sorry you're having a difficult experience. "
                "Let me connect you with a manager who has more "
                "authority to help resolve this. Please hold."
            )
        else:
            await ctx.say(
                "I'll connect you with a manager right away. "
                "Please hold for just a moment."
            )

        # Transfer to escalation queue or human agent
        await ctx.handoff(EscalationAgent, context=caller_ctx)

    async def _handle_general(self, ctx: RunContext, message: str):
        """Handle unclear or general queries."""
        await ctx.say(
            "I want to make sure I connect you with the right person. "
            "Are you calling about a billing question, a technical issue, "
            "or something else?"
        )
```

**Output:**
```
Caller: "Hi, I was charged twice on my credit card last week"
Agent: "I understand you need help with billing. Let me connect you
        with a specialist who can assist. One moment please."
        [Handoff to BillingAgent with context:
         - intent: billing
         - sentiment: neutral
         - entities: {timeframe: "last week", issue: "duplicate charge"}]

Caller: "This is ridiculous, I've called three times already!"
Agent: "I'm sorry you're having a difficult experience. Let me connect
        you with a manager who has more authority to help resolve this.
        Please hold."
        [Handoff to EscalationAgent with context:
         - intent: escalation
         - sentiment: frustrated
         - entities: {prior_calls: 3}]
```

### Hybrid Approach: DTMF Fallback

Some callers prefer pressing keys. Some phone systems don't support speech. Implement both:

```python
class HybridIVR(Agent):
    """IVR that accepts both speech and DTMF input."""

    DTMF_MAPPING = {
        "1": "billing",
        "2": "technical",
        "3": "sales",
        "0": "escalation"
    }

    async def on_enter(self, ctx: RunContext):
        """Offer both options."""
        await ctx.say(
            "Hi, thanks for calling. Tell me how I can help, "
            "or press 1 for billing, 2 for technical support, "
            "3 for sales, or 0 for a representative."
        )

    async def on_dtmf(self, ctx: RunContext, digit: str):
        """Handle keypad input."""
        intent = self.DTMF_MAPPING.get(digit)
        if intent:
            # Route based on DTMF
            await self._route_by_intent(ctx, intent, via_dtmf=True)
        else:
            await ctx.say("I didn't recognize that. Please try again.")

    async def on_user_turn(self, ctx: RunContext, message: str):
        """Handle speech input with LLM classification."""
        classification = await self._classify_intent(ctx, message)
        await self._route_by_intent(
            ctx,
            classification["intent"],
            via_dtmf=False,
            full_context=classification
        )
```

## Call Queuing, Transfer, and Hold

### Queue Management for Voice Agents

When more callers connect than agents can handle, you need queuing:

```python
from asyncio import Queue
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
import asyncio

@dataclass
class QueuedCall:
    """A call waiting in queue."""
    session_id: str
    caller_context: CallerContext
    queued_at: datetime = field(default_factory=datetime.now)
    position: int = 0
    estimated_wait: int = 0  # seconds

class CallQueue:
    """Manages waiting callers with position updates."""

    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 100):
        self.queue: Queue[QueuedCall] = Queue(maxsize=max_size)
        self.active_calls: dict[str, QueuedCall] = {}
        self.avg_handle_time: int = 180  # 3 minutes default

    async def enqueue(
        self,
        session_id: str,
        context: CallerContext
    ) -> QueuedCall:
        """Add call to queue and return queue position."""
        position = self.queue.qsize() + 1
        estimated_wait = position * self.avg_handle_time

        queued_call = QueuedCall(
            session_id=session_id,
            caller_context=context,
            position=position,
            estimated_wait=estimated_wait
        )

        await self.queue.put(queued_call)
        self.active_calls[session_id] = queued_call

        return queued_call

    async def dequeue(self) -> Optional[QueuedCall]:
        """Get next call from queue."""
        if self.queue.empty():
            return None

        call = await self.queue.get()
        del self.active_calls[call.session_id]

        # Update positions for remaining callers
        await self._update_positions()

        return call

    async def _update_positions(self):
        """Recalculate positions after dequeue."""
        position = 1
        # This is simplified - production would iterate queue properly
        for session_id, call in self.active_calls.items():
            call.position = position
            call.estimated_wait = position * self.avg_handle_time
            position += 1

class QueueingAgent(Agent):
    """Agent that manages callers in queue."""

    def __init__(self, queue: CallQueue):
        self.queue = queue
        self.update_interval = 60  # seconds

    async def on_enter(self, ctx: RunContext):
        """Inform caller of queue status."""
        caller_ctx = ctx.handoff_context
        queued = await self.queue.enqueue(ctx.session.id, caller_ctx)

        await ctx.say(
            f"All of our specialists are currently helping other callers. "
            f"You are number {queued.position} in the queue. "
            f"Estimated wait time is about {queued.estimated_wait // 60} minutes. "
            f"Please hold, and we'll be with you shortly."
        )

        # Start hold music and periodic updates
        await self._start_hold_experience(ctx, queued)

    async def _start_hold_experience(
        self,
        ctx: RunContext,
        queued: QueuedCall
    ):
        """Play music and provide periodic updates."""
        while queued.position > 0:
            # Play hold music for update_interval
            await ctx.play_audio("hold_music.mp3", duration=self.update_interval)

            # Check if still in queue
            if ctx.session.id not in self.queue.active_calls:
                break

            # Provide position update
            current = self.queue.active_calls[ctx.session.id]
            if current.position <= 3:
                await ctx.say(
                    f"Thank you for your patience. You're now number "
                    f"{current.position} in the queue. A specialist will "
                    f"be with you very soon."
                )
            else:
                await ctx.say(
                    f"Thank you for holding. You're currently number "
                    f"{current.position}. Estimated wait: "
                    f"{current.estimated_wait // 60} minutes."
                )
```

### Warm Transfer with Context

When transferring between agents, preserve the conversation:

```python
async def warm_transfer(
    ctx: RunContext,
    target_agent: type,
    transfer_context: CallerContext,
    summary: str
):
    """Transfer with full context briefing to receiving agent."""

    # Inform caller
    await ctx.say(
        "I'm going to transfer you to a specialist. I'll brief them "
        "on your situation so you don't need to repeat anything. "
        "Please hold for just a moment."
    )

    # Build enhanced context for receiving agent
    transfer_context.prior_summary = summary
    transfer_context.transferred_from = ctx.agent.__class__.__name__
    transfer_context.transfer_reason = "warm_transfer"

    # Perform handoff
    await ctx.handoff(target_agent, context=transfer_context)
```

**Output:**
```
[After warm transfer]
Specialist: "Hi Sarah, I'm Alex from billing. I understand you were
            charged twice for your March invoice - $49.99 each time.
            Let me look into getting that duplicate refunded for you.
            Can you confirm the last four digits of the card that
            was charged?"

[Caller never repeats the problem - context preserved]
```

## Call Recording with Compliance

### The Compliance Landscape

Call recording is legally required for some industries and legally complex everywhere:

| Jurisdiction | Requirement |
|--------------|-------------|
| **GDPR (EU)** | Explicit consent required; right to access and deletion; data processing agreement |
| **CCPA (California)** | Disclosure required; consumer rights to know and delete |
| **Two-party consent (US)** | All parties must agree (CA, FL, IL, MD, MA, MT, NH, PA, WA, + others) |
| **One-party consent (US)** | Only one party needs to consent (most other states) |
| **PCI-DSS** | Pause recording during credit card input |

### Implementation: Compliant Recording

## Failover and Redundancy Design

### Failure Scenarios

Production telephony systems face multiple failure modes:

| Failure Type | Example | Impact |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Provider outage** | Twilio API returns 503 | All inbound/outbound calls fail |
| **Network partition** | SIP trunk disconnected | Calls connect but no audio |
| **Agent unavailability** | All voice agent pods down | Calls connect but no response |
| **Capacity exhaustion** | Max concurrent calls reached | New calls rejected |

### Multi-Provider Failover Architecture

```python

```

### Graceful Degradation

When all providers fail, degrade gracefully:

```python
class GracefulDegradation:
    """Fallback behaviors when telephony is unavailable."""

    async def handle_inbound_failure(
        self,
        ctx: RunContext,

            recording = await ctx.record_voicemail(max_duration=120)
            await self._queue_voicemail(ctx.session.caller_id, recording)
            await ctx.say(
                "Thank you for your message. We'll call you back "
                "within 24 hours."
            )

        elif failure_reason == "capacity_exceeded":
            # Offer callback

                "Press 1 for callback, or 2 to hold."
            )
            choice = await ctx.wait_for_dtmf(timeout=10)

            if choice == "1":
                await self._schedule_callback(ctx.session.caller_id)
                await ctx.say(
                    "Great, we'll call you back within 30 minutes. "
                    "Thank you for your patience."
                )
            else:
                # Transfer to hold queue

                "website for assistance."
            )
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Hybrid Provider Routing

Use cheaper providers for high-volume, lower-priority traffic:

```python
class CostOptimizedRouter:
    """Routes calls to minimize cost while maintaining quality."""

    def __init__(self, failover: FailoverController):
        self.failover = failover

    def select_provider(
        self,
        call_type: str,
        caller_tier: str,
        expected_duration: int
    ) -> TelephonyProvider:
        """Select provider based on cost optimization rules."""

        # Get healthy providers
        healthy = [
            p for p in self.failover.providers
            if p.status == ProviderStatus.HEALTHY
        ]

        if not healthy:
            return self.failover.get_best_provider()

        # Premium callers get primary provider (best quality)
        if caller_tier == "enterprise":
            return sorted(healthy, key=lambda p: p.priority)[0]

        # Long calls go to cheapest provider
        if expected_duration > 600:  # 10+ minutes
            return sorted(healthy, key=lambda p: p.cost_per_minute)[0]

        # Outbound marketing goes to cheapest
        if call_type == "outbound_marketing":
            return sorted(healthy, key=lambda p: p.cost_per_minute)[0]

        # Default: use priority ordering
        return sorted(healthy, key=lambda p: p.priority)[0]

    def estimate_monthly_cost(
        self,
        minutes_by_type: dict[str, int]
    ) -> dict:
        """Estimate monthly costs with current routing strategy."""

        costs = {}
        total = 0.0

        for call_type, minutes in minutes_by_type.items():
            # Simulate provider selection for each type
            if call_type == "enterprise_support":
                provider = "twilio"
                rate = 0.0085
            elif call_type in ["outbound_marketing", "long_support"]:
                provider = "telnyx"
                rate = 0.002
            else:
                provider = "twilio"
                rate = 0.0085

            cost = minutes * rate
            costs[call_type] = {
                "provider": provider,
                "minutes": minutes,
                "rate": rate,
                "cost": cost
            }
            total += cost

        return {
            "breakdown": costs,
            "total_monthly": total
        }
```

**Output:**
```python
# Example cost comparison
router = CostOptimizedRouter(failover)

# Scenario: 10,000 minutes/month mixed traffic
costs = router.estimate_monthly_cost({
    "enterprise_support": 2000,    # $17.00 via Twilio
    "general_support": 3000,       # $25.50 via Twilio
    "outbound_marketing": 3000,    # $6.00 via Telnyx
    "long_support": 2000           # $4.00 via Telnyx
})

# Result:
# - Without optimization (all Twilio): $85.00/month
# - With hybrid routing: $52.50/month
# - Savings: 38%
```

Add these sections to `.claude/skills/voice-telephony/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
## IVR Patterns

### Natural Language IVR
1. Greet caller conversationally (no menu tree)
2. Use LLM to classify intent from free speech
3. Route to specialist with full context
4. Provide DTMF fallback for accessibility

### Queue Management
- Announce position and estimated wait
- Provide periodic updates (every 60 seconds)
- Offer callback option for long waits

## Compliance

### Recording Consent by Region
- GDPR (EU): Explicit consent required, 30-day retention
- CCPA (California): Disclosure required, 90-day retention
- Two-party consent states: All parties must agree
- One-party consent: Disclosure sufficient

### PCI-DSS
- Pause recording during credit card input
- Resume after sensitive data collection

## High Availability

### Failover Strategy
1. Primary: Twilio (highest quality)
2. Secondary: Telnyx (cost-effective)
3. Tertiary: SignalWire (backup)

### Health Monitoring
- Check provider health every 30 seconds
- Mark degraded on 429/503 responses
- Mark unhealthy on timeout/error

### Graceful Degradation
- Agent unavailable: Offer voicemail
- Capacity exceeded: Offer callback
- Provider outage: Apologize and retry message

### Browser Compatibility Matrix
| Browser | getUserMedia | AudioWorklet | WASM SIMD |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Chrome 76+ | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Firefox 76+ | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Safari 14.1+ | Yes | Yes | Partial |
| Edge 79+ | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### Error Handling
1. Permission denied: Show clear instructions
2. HTTPS required: Redirect or warn user
3. AudioWorklet failed: Fall back to ScriptProcessorNode
4. WASM load failed: Use server-side VAD

### Performance Targets
- AudioWorklet latency: < 3ms
- VAD inference: < 1ms per 30ms chunk
- Total browser processing: < 10ms
```

### Test Your Finalized Skills

Verify both skills work with production scenarios:

```
Prompt: "I need to set up a production voice agent with:
- Natural language IVR (no phone tree)
- GDPR-compliant call recording for EU customers
- Automatic failover between Twilio and Telnyx
- Browser audio option for web users

Use my voice-telephony and web-audio-capture skills to walk me
through the complete implementation."
```

Your skills should now generate comprehensive guidance covering all production patterns from this chapter.

## Try With AI

Use both skills with these prompts to solidify production patterns.

### Prompt 1: Design Your IVR

```
I want to build an IVR for my Task Manager phone agent:

Flow requirements:
- Greeting: "Hi, this is Task Manager. How can I help?"
- Intent detection: Natural language, not "press 1 for..."
- Routing:
  - Task queries -> Task Agent
  - Billing -> Billing Agent
  - Technical issues -> Tech Support
  - Frustrated callers -> Immediate escalation
- Fallback: Unclear intent -> Clarification question

Use my voice-telephony skill to help me design:
1. The complete IVR flow with intent classification
2. Context that passes with each handoff type
3. Error handling for unrecognized intent
4. DTMF fallback for accessibility

I'll implement this with my LiveKit agent and test with real callers.
```

**What you're learning**: Modern IVR design replaces rigid phone trees with natural conversation. The key insight is that LLM intent classification provides flexibility that DTMF menus never could, while DTMF fallback ensures accessibility for all callers.

### Prompt 2: Implement Compliant Recording

```
My voice agent needs call recording for:
- Training data collection (improving agent responses)
- Dispute resolution (customer complaints)
- Quality assurance (agent performance review)

But I have users in:
- United States (various states including California)
- European Union (GDPR applies)
- United Kingdom (post-Brexit rules)

Use my voice-telephony skill to help me:
1. What consent announcements are required for each region?
2. How do I detect caller region from phone number?
3. What retention policies should I implement?
4. How do I handle GDPR deletion requests?
5. When must I pause recording (PCI compliance)?

I need a complete compliance implementation, not just guidance.
```

**What you're learning**: Compliance engineering requires understanding that recording laws vary by jurisdiction and consent type. The key patterns are: detect region, apply appropriate consent flow, implement retention policies, and provide deletion mechanisms for data subject requests.

### Prompt 3: Design Failover Architecture

```
My production voice agent needs 99.9% uptime. Current setup:
- Primary: Twilio Voice (quality preference)
- Backup: Telnyx (cost optimization)
- Voice agent: LiveKit on Kubernetes (3 pods)
- Expected volume: 10,000 calls/month growing 20%

Failure scenarios I need to handle:
1. Twilio API outage (happened twice last year)
2. My Kubernetes cluster restart during deployment
3. Network connectivity issues
4. Capacity exceeded during traffic spike

Use my voice-telephony skill to design:
1. Health monitoring for both providers
2. Automatic failover logic
3. Graceful degradation when both providers fail
4. Recovery procedures after outage
5. Alerting and monitoring setup

I want a multi-provider, multi-region architecture that truly
achieves 99.9% uptime. Walk me through the design with concrete
configuration.
```

**What you're learning**: High-availability telephony requires multiple layers of redundancy. The key insight is that 99.9% uptime (8.7 hours downtime/year) requires failover at every layer: provider, network, and application. Graceful degradation (voicemail, callback) maintains customer experience even during total failures.

### Safety Note

Production telephony systems handle real customer conversations with legal and financial implications. Before deploying:

- Test IVR flows with diverse accents and speaking styles
- Verify recording consent flows meet legal requirements for ALL your caller jurisdictions
- Validate failover by intentionally failing primary provider in staging
- Monitor sentiment trends to catch systemic issues before they escalate
- Document your compliance implementation for audit purposes
