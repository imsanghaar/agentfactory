# Chapter 69: Evaluation & Quality Gates

Ship only what passes the gates. This chapter builds an `evaluation` skill to define metrics, automate eval runs, and enforce acceptance thresholds for your models.

---

## Goals

- Create evaluation taxonomies for task and safety metrics
- Implement automated eval pipelines for tuned models
- Set acceptance thresholds and quality gates
- Capture evaluation prompts/scripts in a reusable skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Build the evaluation skill
- Evaluation taxonomy and metrics
- Automated eval runs and reporting
- Quality gates and thresholds for promotion
- Capstone: eval suite for Task API models; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with repeatable evals and quality gates that guard every model release, plus a reusable evaluation skill.

---

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 63-68 (data through safety)
