# Chapter 72: Capstone — End-to-End LLMOps

Pull everything together. You run an end-to-end pipeline—data, training, evaluation, safety, serving, and integration—then package the final `llmops` skill.

---

## Goals

- Execute the full LLMOps pipeline on the Task API use case
- Enforce evaluation and safety gates before deployment
- Deploy and integrate the custom model with your agents
- Finalize and document your comprehensive LLMOps skill

---

## Capstone Flow

1) Data curation and validation  
2) Fine-tuning (persona/function calling as needed)  
3) Merging/optimization (optional)  
4) Safety alignment and evaluations with quality gates  
5) Serving with versioning/traffic controls  
6) Integration with agent frameworks and MCP  
7) Monitoring, rollback, and documentation of the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a production-ready custom model powering your Task API agents plus a documented, reusable LLMOps skill that encodes the entire lifecycle.

---

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Chapters 61-71
