# Chapter 68: Alignment & Safety

Keep models safe and compliant. This chapter builds an `alignment-safety` skill to design safety policies, refusals, and evaluations that pair with your tuned models.

---

## Goals

- Define safety policies and refusal behaviors for your domain
- Build safety/alignment datasets and tests
- Apply safety tuning or policy stacks
- Evaluate with safety-specific metrics and red-team checks
- Capture patterns in a reusable alignment skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Build the alignment-safety skill
- Safety policies and refusal design
- Safety data creation and tuning
- Safety evaluation and red teaming
- Capstone: safety-hardened Task API model; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with safety policies and tests applied to your tuned model plus a reusable alignment skill.
