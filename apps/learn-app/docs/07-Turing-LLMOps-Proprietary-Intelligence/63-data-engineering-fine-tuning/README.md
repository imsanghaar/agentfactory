# Chapter 63: Data Engineering for Fine-Tuning

High-quality data wins fine-tuning. This chapter builds a `fine-tuning-data` skill to design tasks, clean/validate datasets, generate synthetic data, and version everything for reproducibility.

---

## Goals

- Define data quality principles for SFT datasets
- Structure instruction/response formats for your tasks
- Generate and validate synthetic data safely
- Version datasets for reproducibility
- Package the process into a reusable data-engineering skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Build the data-engineering skill
- Data quality principles and instruction formats
- Synthetic data generation and validation
- Task API dataset creation and versioning
- Capstone: production-ready dataset; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a clean, versioned dataset for the Task API and a reusable data-engineering skill that feeds later fine-tuning chapters.

---

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 61-62 (strategy and architecture)
