# Chapter 70: Deployment & Serving

Turn trained models into reliable services. This chapter builds a `model-serving` skill for deploying custom models with versioning, autoscaling, and cost/latency controls.

---

## Goals

- Choose serving backends and hardware for your models
- Configure versioning, traffic splitting, and rollback
- Add autoscaling, caching, and rate limits to control cost/latency
- Integrate served models with your agent stack
- Capture deployment patterns in a reusable serving skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Build the model-serving skill
- Serving architectures and infrastructure choices
- Versioning, traffic management, rollback
- Autoscaling/caching/rate limiting
- Integration with agents/APIs
- Capstone: deployed Task API model endpoint; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a production model endpoint wired to your agents and a reusable serving skill.
