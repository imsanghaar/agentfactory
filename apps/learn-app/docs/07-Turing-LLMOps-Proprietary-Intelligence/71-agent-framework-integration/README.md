# Chapter 71: Agent Framework Integration

Connect your custom models to the agent stack you built in Parts 6-7. This chapter builds an `llm-integration` skill for OpenAI/Anthropic/Google SDKs and MCP servers.

## Goals

- Wire custom models into OpenAI/Anthropic/Google agent SDKs
- Expose models through MCP servers for interoperability
- Ensure type/contract compatibility with your clients
- Package integration patterns in a reusable skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Build the integration skill
- SDK integrations across providers
- MCP server exposure and testing
- Contract/compatibility checks
- Capstone: custom model powering your Task API agents; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with your tuned model integrated into agent frameworks and MCP, plus a reusable integration skill.
