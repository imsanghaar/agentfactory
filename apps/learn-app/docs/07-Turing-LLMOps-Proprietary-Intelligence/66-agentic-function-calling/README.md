# Chapter 66: Agentic Function Calling

Teach models to call tools reliably. This chapter builds an `agentic-function-calling` skill to create datasets, tune, and evaluate function/tool use for your Task API agents.

---

## Goals

- Define tool schemas and structured output expectations
- Generate/tune datasets for function calls and arguments
- Evaluate tool-use accuracy and robustness
- Orchestrate multi-tool flows safely
- Capture reusable prompts and tests in a skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Build the function-calling skill
- Tool schema design and dataset creation
- Fine-tuning/evaluation for function use
- Multi-tool orchestration patterns
- Capstone: tool-capable Task API model; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a function-calling–capable model plus a skill that standardizes tool schemas, data, and evaluations.

---

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 63-65 (data, SFT, persona)
- Part 6 agent/tool patterns for context
