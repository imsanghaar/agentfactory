# Chapter 61: Introduction to LLMOps

Start with the strategy. This chapter builds an `llmops-strategy` skill to decide when to fine-tune, map use cases, and outline the LLM lifecycle before touching training pipelines.

---

## Goals

- Distinguish prompting vs. fine-tuning vs. model selection
- Map business problems to LLMOps approaches and economics
- Define the LLM lifecycle (data, training, eval, deploy, operate)
- Create a decision framework skill for future chapters

---

## Lesson Progression

- LLMOps landscape and lifecycle
- When to fine-tune vs. prompt/architect
- Economics and ROI considerations
- Build and finalize the LLMOps decision skill

Each lesson ends with a reflection to test, find gaps, and improve.

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a decision framework skill that guides all later fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment work.

---

## Prerequisites

- Parts 4-7 (specs, Python, cloud foundations)
