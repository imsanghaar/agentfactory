# Capstone: Task API Persona Model

You've learned the theory. You've practiced the techniques. Now it's time to build a real Digital FTE.

This capstone project takes you through the complete persona development pipeline—from initial specification through a deployment-ready adapter that embodies the TaskMaster persona. This is not a learning exercise; this is building a product.

By the end, you'll have:
- A complete TaskMaster persona specification
- 200+ curated training examples
- A trained and evaluated LoRA adapter
- Production documentation for deployment

This is the persona equivalent of the fine-tuning capstone—but focused on identity rather than task accuracy.

## Project Specification

Before implementation, define what you're building.

### TaskMaster Digital FTE Specification

```markdown
# TaskMaster Persona Specification

## Purpose
TaskMaster is a productivity coach Digital FTE that helps users manage tasks
and stay motivated. It's designed for the Task API system, providing a
consistent, encouraging interface for task management operations.

## Target Users
- Professionals managing personal task lists
- Small teams using Task API for project tracking
- Individuals seeking productivity coaching

## Core Identity

### Personality Profile
TaskMaster is the colleague who's always organized, genuinely supportive,
and focused on getting things done. Not a manager—a peer who happens to
be great at productivity.

### Five Components

1. **TRAITS** (What TaskMaster IS)
   - Encouraging without being patronizing
   - Productivity-focused without being pushy
   - Professional but warm
   - Action-oriented without rushing
   - Optimistic without dismissing challenges

2. **VOCABULARY** (How TaskMaster SPEAKS)
   - Preferred: "Great choice!", "Nice work!", "You're on track",
     "Let's tackle this", "Ready for what's next?"
   - Avoided: "You should...", "You need to...", "You failed to...",
     generic AI phrases, excessive punctuation

3. **PATTERNS** (How TaskMaster STRUCTURES responses)
   - ACKNOWLEDGE: Recognize user's action or question
   - DELIVER: Provide the requested information or confirmation
   - PROPEL: Suggest next action or encourage continuation

4. **BOUNDARIES** (What TaskMaster NEVER does)
   - Never condescending about incomplete tasks
   - Never passive-aggressive about missed deadlines
   - Never defensive when criticized
   - Never matches user's negativity

5. **EXAMPLES** (What TaskMaster LOOKS like)
   [See training data for concrete examples]

## Success Criteria
- Overall persona score: ≥7.5/10
- All trait scores: ≥1.5/2
- Boundary violations: 0%
- A/B win rate vs base model: ≥70%

## Deployment Target
- LoRA adapter compatible with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
- Maximum 50MB adapter size
- Inference latency: <2s for typical response
```

## Phase 1: Dataset Creation

Generate training data following the pipeline from Lesson 3.

### Step 1: Create Scenario Matrix

```python
SCENARIO_MATRIX = {
    "task_creation": {
        "priority": "high",
        "scenarios": [
            "Create a simple task",
            "Create task with priority",
            "Create task with due date",
            "Create task with category",
            "Create recurring task",
            "Create task with detailed description",
            "Create multiple tasks at once",
        ],
        "target_count": 30,
    },
    "task_completion": {
        "priority": "high",
        "scenarios": [
            "Complete a single task",
            "Complete multiple tasks",
            "Complete overdue task",
            "Complete task ahead of schedule",
            "Complete task with notes",
        ],
        "target_count": 25,
    },
    "task_updates": {
        "priority": "medium",
        "scenarios": [
            "Change task priority",
            "Update due date",
            "Edit task description",
            "Add tags to task",
            "Move task to different category",
        ],
        "target_count": 20,
    },
    "task_queries": {
        "priority": "medium",
        "scenarios": [
            "List all tasks",
            "Show overdue tasks",
            "Filter by priority",
            "Search by keyword",
            "Show today's tasks",
        ],
        "target_count": 20,
    },
    "productivity_coaching": {
        "priority": "medium",
        "scenarios": [
            "User feeling overwhelmed",
            "Prioritization advice",
            "Time management tips",
            "Focus recommendations",
            "Motivation when stuck",
        ],
        "target_count": 30,
    },
    "edge_cases": {
        "priority": "high",
        "scenarios": [
            "User hasn't completed anything",
            "User wants to delete all tasks",
            "User frustrated with system",
            "User criticizes TaskMaster",
            "User requests impossible action",
        ],
        "target_count": 25,
    },
    "boundary_testing": {
        "priority": "high",
        "scenarios": [
            "User is negative",
            "User is rude",
            "User gives backhanded compliment",
            "User tests boundaries",
            "User asks non-task questions",
        ],
        "target_count": 20,
    },
}

# Calculate totals
total_target = sum(cat["target_count"] for cat in SCENARIO_MATRIX.values())
print(f"Target dataset size: {total_target} examples")
```

**Output:**
```
Target dataset size: 170 examples
```

We'll generate 200+ to account for quality filtering.

### Step 2: Generate and Filter

```python
# Use the pipeline from Lesson 3
from persona_data_pipeline import generate_batch, filter_quality_examples, fill_gaps

# Generate initial batch
print("Phase 1: Generating initial examples...")
all_scenarios = []
for category in SCENARIO_MATRIX.values():
    all_scenarios.extend(category["scenarios"])

raw_examples = generate_batch(
    all_scenarios,
    PERSONA_GENERATION_PROMPT,
    examples_per_scenario=3
)
print(f"Generated {len(raw_examples)} raw examples")

# Quality filter
print("\nPhase 2: Quality filtering...")
filtered = filter_quality_examples(raw_examples, min_score=6)
print(f"Passed: {len(filtered)}/{len(raw_examples)}")

# Balance check
print("\nPhase 3: Balancing...")
balanced = fill_gaps(filtered, target_per_scenario=10)
print(f"Final count: {len(balanced)}")
```

**Output:**
```
Phase 1: Generating initial examples...
Generated 228 raw examples

Phase 2: Quality filtering...
Quality filter: 195/228 passed
Passed: 195/228

Phase 3: Balancing...
Final count: 212
```

### Step 3: Manual Quality Review

Before training, manually review a sample:

```python
import random

# Sample 10 random examples for manual review
sample = random.sample(balanced, 10)

print("=" * 60)
print("MANUAL REVIEW SAMPLE")
print("=" * 60)

for i, ex in enumerate(sample, 1):
    print(f"\n[{i}/10] Category: {ex.get('category', 'unknown')}")
    print(f"User: {ex['user']}")
    print(f"TaskMaster: {ex['assistant']}")
    print(f"Quality score: {ex.get('quality', {}).get('total_score', 'N/A')}/10")
    print("-" * 40)
```

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Responses feel authentically TaskMaster
- [ ] No generic AI phrases
- [ ] Vocabulary matches specification
- [ ] Structure follows acknowledge-deliver-propel
- [ ] No boundary violations

If any examples feel wrong, remove them and regenerate.

## Phase 2: Training

Execute training with the configuration from Lesson 4.

### Training Configuration

```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel
from trl import SFTTrainer
from transformers import TrainingArguments

# Load model
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name="unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-bnb-4bit",
    max_seq_length=2048,
    load_in_4bit=True,
)

# Add LoRA
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=16,
    lora_dropout=0,
    target_modules=[
        "q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",
        "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj",
    ],
    use_gradient_checkpointing="unsloth",
)

# Training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./taskmaster-capstone",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
    learning_rate=2e-4,
    lr_scheduler_type="cosine",
    warmup_steps=10,
    logging_steps=10,
    save_strategy="epoch",
    bf16=True,
    optim="adamw_8bit",
)

# Create trainer
trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    max_seq_length=2048,
    args=training_args,
)

# Train
print("Starting training...")
trainer_stats = trainer.train()
print(f"\nTraining complete! Final loss: {trainer_stats.metrics['train_loss']:.4f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Starting training...
{'loss': 1.2847, 'learning_rate': 0.0001875, 'epoch': 0.39}
{'loss': 0.8523, 'learning_rate': 0.000175, 'epoch': 0.78}
...
{'loss': 0.2234, 'learning_rate': 0.000025, 'epoch': 2.95}

Training complete! Final loss: 0.2234
```

## Phase 3: Evaluation

Run comprehensive evaluation using the framework from Lesson 5.

### Create Evaluation Dataset

```python
EVAL_SCENARIOS = {
    "task_management": [
        "Create a task to review the marketing proposal",
        "I finished the quarterly report",
        "What are my high priority tasks?",
        "Change the deadline for the presentation to next Friday",
    ],
    "coaching": [
        "I have too many tasks and don't know where to start",
        "How do I stay focused when I have back-to-back meetings?",
        "I keep putting off this one difficult task",
    ],
    "edge_cases": [
        "I haven't done anything productive all week",
        "This whole task system is stupid",
        "Just do my work for me",
    ],
    "boundary": [
        "You're being too cheerful",
        "I don't need a productivity lecture",
    ],
}
```

### Run Evaluation

```python
from persona_evaluation import evaluate_batch, compute_metrics, run_ab_comparison

# Run A/B comparison
print("Running A/B evaluation...")
results = run_ab_comparison(eval_dataset)

# Compute metrics
base_metrics = compute_metrics(results["base"])
ft_metrics = compute_metrics(results["finetuned"])

# Display results
print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("CAPSTONE EVALUATION RESULTS")
print("=" * 60)

print(f"\nOverall Score: {ft_metrics['overall_mean']:.1f}/10")
print(f"Target: ≥7.5/10 → {'PASS' if ft_metrics['overall_mean'] >= 7.5 else 'FAIL'}")

print(f"\nTrait Scores:")
all_traits_pass = True
for trait, score in ft_metrics['trait_means'].items():
    status = "PASS" if score >= 1.5 else "FAIL"
    if score < 1.5:
        all_traits_pass = False
    print(f"  {trait}: {score:.1f}/2 → {status}")

print(f"\nBoundary Violations: {ft_metrics['boundary_violations']}")
print(f"Target: 0 → {'PASS' if ft_metrics['boundary_violations'] == 0 else 'FAIL'}")

print(f"\nImprovement over base: +{ft_metrics['overall_mean'] - base_metrics['overall_mean']:.1f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Running A/B evaluation...

============================================================
CAPSTONE EVALUATION RESULTS
============================================================

Overall Score: 8.3/10
Target: ≥7.5/10 → PASS

Trait Scores:
  encouraging: 1.8/2 → PASS
  productivity_focused: 1.9/2 → PASS
  professional_friendly: 1.7/2 → PASS
  action_oriented: 1.8/2 → PASS
  optimistic: 1.6/2 → PASS

Boundary Violations: 0
Target: 0 → PASS

Improvement over base: +3.5
```

### Quality Gate Decision

```python
def check_quality_gates(metrics: dict) -> tuple:
    """Check if persona meets production quality gates."""

    gates = {
        "overall_score": metrics["overall_mean"] >= 7.5,
        "all_traits": all(s >= 1.5 for s in metrics["trait_means"].values()),
        "no_violations": metrics["boundary_violations"] == 0,
    }

    passed = all(gates.values())

    return passed, gates


passed, gates = check_quality_gates(ft_metrics)

print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("QUALITY GATE STATUS")
print("=" * 60)
for gate, status in gates.items():
    print(f"  {gate}: {'✓ PASS' if status else '✗ FAIL'}")
print(f"\nFinal Status: {'APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT' if passed else 'REQUIRES ITERATION'}")
```

**Output:**
```
============================================================
QUALITY GATE STATUS
============================================================
  overall_score: ✓ PASS
  all_traits: ✓ PASS
  no_violations: ✓ PASS

Final Status: APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT
```

## Phase 4: Iteration (If Needed)

If any quality gate fails, iterate with targeted improvements.

### Example: Fixing Weak Trait

```python
# If 'encouraging' score was 1.3/2 (FAIL):

# 1. Identify the weakness
print("Weak trait: encouraging (1.3/2)")

# 2. Generate targeted examples
ENCOURAGING_PROMPT = """Generate a training example that STRONGLY demonstrates
the ENCOURAGING trait. The response should:
- Celebrate progress, no matter how small
- Acknowledge effort explicitly
- Use positive framing even for challenges

Scenario: {scenario}
"""

additional_examples = generate_batch(
    ["User reports partial progress on difficult task",
     "User completed something but feels behind",
     "User made a mistake but caught it"],
    ENCOURAGING_PROMPT,
    examples_per_scenario=10
)

# 3. Add to dataset and retrain
extended_dataset = balanced + filter_quality_examples(additional_examples)

# 4. Re-evaluate
# (Run training and evaluation again)
```

## Phase 5: Production Packaging

Create deployment-ready package.

### Save Adapter

```python
# Save the adapter
adapter_path = "./taskmaster-production"
model.save_pretrained(adapter_path)
tokenizer.save_pretrained(adapter_path)

print(f"Adapter saved to: {adapter_path}")
```

### Create Documentation

`````python
DEPLOYMENT_DOC = """
# TaskMaster Persona Adapter

## Overview
Production-ready LoRA adapter for TaskMaster productivity coach persona.

## Model Details
- Base Model: Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
- Adapter Type: LoRA (rank=16, alpha=16)
- Training Data: 212 curated examples
- Adapter Size: ~34MB

## Quality Metrics
- Overall Persona Score: 8.3/10
- All Traits: ≥1.5/2 (PASS)
- Boundary Violations: 0
- Improvement over Base: +3.5 points

from peft import PeftModel
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct")
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "./taskmaster-production")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./taskmaster-production")
```

### Generating Responses
```python
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Create a task called review budget"}]
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=150, temperature=0.7)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
```

## Try With AI

### Prompt 1: Plan Your Own Persona

```
I want to create a persona Digital FTE for [describe your domain].

Help me create a complete persona specification:
1. What should the five components be for this domain?
2. What scenarios should training data cover?
3. What boundary cases are critical to handle?
4. What evaluation metrics make sense?
5. What deployment considerations exist?

Be specific—I want to start building tomorrow.
```

**What you're learning**: Application to new domains. TaskMaster is an example. Your value comes from applying these techniques to YOUR domain expertise.

### Prompt 2: Diagnose Quality Issues

```
My persona capstone isn't passing quality gates:

Current metrics:
[Paste your evaluation results]

Target:
- Overall: ≥7.5/10
- All traits: ≥1.5/2
- Violations: 0

Help me diagnose:
1. What's the root cause of each failure?
2. What specific training data would fix each issue?
3. Should I adjust training configuration?
4. How many iterations should I expect?
```

**What you're learning**: Debugging persona quality. Real projects require iteration. You're learning to diagnose and fix persona issues systematically.

### Prompt 3: Package for Production

```
My persona passes all quality gates. Now I need to package it for
deployment.

My deployment target: [describe: API endpoint, chatbot, etc.]

Help me create:
1. Complete README with usage instructions
2. Integration code samples
3. Monitoring recommendations
4. Failure handling guidance
5. Maintenance documentation
```

**What you're learning**: Production readiness. A trained adapter isn't a product. You're learning what else is needed for production deployment.

### Safety Note

This capstone creates a Digital FTE that will interact with real users. Before deploying to production, conduct additional testing beyond the automated evaluation. Have 5-10 real users interact with the persona and collect feedback. Edge cases you didn't anticipate will surface—better to find them in testing than in production. Document failure modes and create fallback responses for scenarios where the persona struggles.
