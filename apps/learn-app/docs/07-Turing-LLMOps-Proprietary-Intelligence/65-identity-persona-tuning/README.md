# Chapter 65: Identity & Persona Tuning

Shape how your model speaks. This chapter builds a `persona-tuning` skill to encode tone, role, and guardrails so outputs stay on-brand and safe.

---

## Goals

- Differentiate system prompts vs. persona tuning
- Design datasets for tone/style without breaking task accuracy
- Run persona-focused fine-tuning/conditioning
- Validate safety and style adherence
- Capture patterns in a reusable persona skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Build the persona-tuning skill
- System prompts vs. tuned identity
- Data design for tone/style
- Persona tuning run and evaluation
- Capstone: brand-aligned Task API persona; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a persona-tuned model (or prompt stack) and a reusable persona skill for future products.

---

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 63-64 (data + SFT foundations)
