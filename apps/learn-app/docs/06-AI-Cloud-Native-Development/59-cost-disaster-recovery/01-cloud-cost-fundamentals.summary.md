### Core Concept
Cloud cost fundamentals establish how usage turns into spend—covering drivers, allocation, and the FinOps lifecycle (Inform → Optimize → Operate) to manage budgets deliberately.

### Key Mental Models
- **Unit economics**: Map resources to cost units (per namespace/team/product).
- **Visibility first**: You can’t optimize what you can’t see—measure before cutting.
- **Lifecycle discipline**: Continuous loop of measurement, optimization, governance.

### Critical Patterns
- Label workloads for cost allocation; ingest metrics into cost tools.
- Identify primary drivers (compute, storage, data transfer) and set budgets/alerts.
- Separate fixed vs variable costs; forecast and compare to actuals regularly.

### Common Mistakes
- Skipping tagging/labeling, making costs un-attributable.
- Reacting to bills without real-time visibility, leading to surprise overages.
- Optimizing blindly (cutting critical resources) without understanding drivers.

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Observability foundations.
- **Leads to**: Right-sizing with VPA, Opencost visibility, and FinOps practices in subsequent lessons.
