### Core Concept
Kick off Chapter 59 by creating an operational-excellence skill covering cost optimization and disaster recovery, grounded in official docs and refined across the chapter.

### Key Mental Models
- **Skill-first**: Build the skill before deep dives; iterate after each lesson.
- **Cost + resilience twin goals**: Optimize spend while protecting availability and data.
- **Doc-driven**: Use authoritative sources, not memory, for patterns (FinOps, backup/restore, chaos).

### Critical Patterns
- Use `/skill-creator` with fetched references to capture patterns for cost visibility, right-sizing, backups, DR, and chaos testing.
- Define success criteria in LEARNING-SPEC (queries, alerts, runbooks).
- Validate the skill by generating OpEx playbooks and manifests, then dry-run/apply them.

### Common Mistakes
- Building skills without doc grounding, leading to unreliable guidance.
- Treating cost and resilience separately instead of as coupled objectives.
- Skipping verification prompts, leaving gaps in the skill.

### Connections
- **Builds on**: Observability, GitOps, security foundations.
- **Leads to**: Applying cost fundamentals, right-sizing, backups, and DR in later lessons.
