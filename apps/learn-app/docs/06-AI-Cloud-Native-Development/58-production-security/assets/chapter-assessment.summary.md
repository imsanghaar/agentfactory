### Core Concept
Use this assessment to verify Chapter 58 mastery—confirm each security control is understood, applied, and evidenced before moving on.

### Key Mental Models
- **Control coverage**: RBAC, NetworkPolicy, PSS, secrets, supply chain, Dapr security, and compliance each need checks.
- **Evidence-oriented**: Answers should reference manifests, logs, and policy results, not just theory.

### Critical Patterns
- Validate least-privilege RBAC, default-deny networking, PSS enforcement, and secret handling with external stores.
- Show image scanning/signing results and Dapr mTLS/component scoping in place.
- Provide audit logs and control mappings as proof for compliance.

### Common Mistakes
- Describing intentions without showing applied policies or test outputs.
- Ignoring evidence for compliance/observability of controls.
- Overlooking one layer (e.g., leaving default service account tokens or open egress).

### Connections
- **Builds on**: All Chapter 58 lessons.
- **Leads to**: Capstone verification and readiness for Chapter 59 resilience topics.
