# Chapter 56: Traffic Engineering

Traffic engineering exposes your Kubernetes agent to the world with safe ingress, routing, and autoscaling. You build a `traffic-engineer` skill that covers Gateway API (the Ingress successor), Envoy Gateway, rate limiting, TLS, traffic splitting, and KEDA-based scaling.

---

## Goals

- Understand Gateway API concepts and deploy Envoy Gateway
- Route traffic with HTTPRoute (paths, headers, query matching)
- Apply rate limiting, retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking
- Terminate TLS with CertManager
- Run canary/blue-green splits and autoscale with KEDA
- Manage LLM traffic with Envoy AI Gateway patterns
- Package the patterns into a reusable traffic-engineer skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- **L00**: Build Your Traffic Engineering Skill
- **L01-L03**: Ingress fundamentals → Gateway API concepts
- **L04-L06**: Envoy Gateway setup; routing; rate limiting and resilience
- **L07-L08**: TLS with CertManager; traffic splitting (canary/blue-green)
- **L09-L10**: KEDA autoscaling; resilience patterns
- **L11**: Envoy AI Gateway for LLM traffic
- **L12**: Capstone—production traffic for the Task API; finalize the skill

Each lesson ends with a reflection to test, find gaps, and improve the skill.

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with production-ready ingress for the Task API: Gateway API + Envoy Gateway, TLS, rate limiting, resilience, canary/blue-green, KEDA autoscaling, and AI Gateway patterns—plus a reusable traffic-engineer skill. The chapter follows the skill-first flow: learn, apply, capstone, finalize.

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 49-55 (containerized, deployed, observable service)
- Gateway/Helm familiarity for controller installs
