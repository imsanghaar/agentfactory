# Chapter 57: Dapr Actors & Workflows

Add durable state and orchestration to your agents. This chapter builds a `dapr-actors-workflows` skill that uses Dapr virtual actors for per-entity state and Dapr Workflows for long-running, reliable processes.

---

## Goals

- Understand the actor model: virtual actors, turn-based concurrency, lifecycle
- Implement Dapr Actors for agent state (sessions, conversations, tasks)
- Use timers and reminders for scheduled work
- Design Dapr Workflows for durable orchestration with retries/compensation
- Combine actors and workflows for complex agent behaviors
- Package patterns into a reusable skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Actor model foundations
- Dapr Actor fundamentals and state management
- Timers and reminders
- Workflow patterns: sequential, parallel, saga/compensation
- Failure handling and retries
- Capstone: stateful agent with actors + workflows; finalize the skill

Each lesson ends with a reflection to test, find gaps, and improve the skill.

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a stateful Task API that uses actors for per-entity state and workflows for long-running tasks, plus a Dapr actors/workflows skill. The chapter follows the skill-first flow: learn, apply, capstone, finalize.

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 49-53 (containerized, Kubernetes, Helm, Dapr Core)
- Chapter 55 observability for monitoring actors/workflows
