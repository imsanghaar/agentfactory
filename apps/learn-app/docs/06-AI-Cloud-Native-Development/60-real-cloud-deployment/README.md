# Chapter 60: Real Cloud Deployment

You build a `multi-cloud-deployer` skill first, then deploy the Task API to a managed Kubernetes cluster (GKE/AKS/EKS/DOKS). The pattern is universal: provision the cluster, connect kubectl, deploy manifests/Helm/ArgoCD.

---

## Goals

- Provision managed Kubernetes clusters on major clouds
- Authenticate kubectl/Helm/ArgoCD to the new cluster
- Deploy your existing manifests/Helm charts/ArgoCD apps to the cloud
- Validate health, scaling, ingress, TLS, and cost controls
- Capture cloud-specific steps in a reusable deployment skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Build Your Cloud Deployment Skill (skill-first)
- Provisioning patterns per cloud (GKE, AKS, EKS, DOKS)
- Connect tooling (kubectl, Helm, ArgoCD) to the managed cluster
- Deploy the Task API with existing charts/pipelines
- Validate traffic, observability, security, and scaling
- Capstone: end-to-end cloud deployment; finalize the skill

Each lesson ends with a reflection to test, find gaps, and improve.

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with the Task API running on a managed cloud Kubernetes cluster and a reusable multi-cloud deployment skill. The chapter applies the skill-first approach plus a spec-driven capstone.

---

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 49-59 (images, Kubernetes, Helm, GitOps, traffic, security, observability)
- Cloud account/CLI access for your chosen provider
