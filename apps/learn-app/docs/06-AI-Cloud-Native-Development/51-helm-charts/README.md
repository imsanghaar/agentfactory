# Chapter 51: Helm Charts for AI Services

You build the `helm-chart` skill first, then refine it through templating, testing, and distribution patterns so you can ship production-ready charts for your agents.

---

## Goals

- Master Helm templating (Go templates, helpers, values)
- Design multi-environment charts with schema validation
- Compose dependencies and hooks for lifecycle control
- Test and lint charts before release
- Publish and consume charts from OCI registries
- Capture the patterns in a reusable Helm skill

## Lesson Progression

| # | Lesson | Focus |
|---|--------|-------|
| **0** | Build Your Helm Skill | Scaffold from official docs |
| 1 | Helm Introduction | Chart basics and what the skill generates |
| 2-4 | Templating Foundation | Templates, helpers, values hierarchy |
| 5-6 | Advanced Patterns | Dependencies, hooks, lifecycle |
| 7 | Testing Charts | Linting and template debugging |
| 8 | OCI Registries | Push/pull/install from OCI |
| 9 | Library Charts | Standardized building blocks |
| 10 | AI-Assisted Development | Use AI to author/refine charts |
| **11** | Capstone: Production Chart | Ship a production-ready chart |

Each lesson ends with a skill reflection: test, find gaps, and improve the skill.

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a production Helm chart for your Kubernetes-deployed agent plus a refined Helm skill. The chapter follows the 4-Layer method: foundational templating → advanced composition → AI-assisted authoring → spec-driven capstone.

---

## Prerequisites

- Chapter 50 Kubernetes fundamentals (Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, RBAC, HPA)
- Working Docker Desktop Kubernetes cluster and kubectl access
- **Create Library Charts**: Organizational standards that enforce consistency
- **Build Reusable Intelligence**: A Helm Chart Architect skill for AI-native development

## Looking Ahead

After mastering Helm, you'll use your charts in:
- **Chapter 52 (Kafka)**: Event-driven architecture with Helm-deployed message brokers
- **Chapter 55 (CI/CD)**: GitOps pipelines that automatically deploy your Helm charts
- **Chapter 56 (Observability)**: Monitoring charts with Prometheus and Grafana dependencies
