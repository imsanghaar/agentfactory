# Chapter 54: CI/CD Pipelines & GitOps with ArgoCD

You build the `gitops-deployment` skill first, then refine it across CI/CD foundations and ArgoCD GitOps patterns until you have a production pipeline for your agent services.

---

## Goals

- Design CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions (build, test, quality gates)
- Apply GitOps principles with ArgoCD as the declarative source of truth
- Configure ArgoCD apps, sync strategies/waves/hooks
- Scale with ApplicationSets; secure with Projects/RBAC and secrets management
- Run progressive delivery (canary/blue-green) with health/notification hooks
- Operate multi-cluster GitOps and capture patterns in a reusable skill

## Lesson Progression

| # | Lesson | Focus |
|---|--------|-------|
| **0** | Build Your GitOps Skill | Scaffold from docs |
| 1-4 | CI/CD Fundamentals | Concepts, Actions workflows, Docker builds, tests |
| 5-9 | GitOps & ArgoCD Core | Principles, architecture, first app, sync strategies/waves |
| 10-15 | Production Patterns | ApplicationSets, RBAC/Projects, health/notifications, progressive delivery, secrets, multi-cluster |
| 16 | AI-Assisted GitOps | Use AI to author/review pipelines |
| **17** | Capstone: End-to-End Pipeline | Commit-to-cluster production pipeline |
| 18 | Finalize GitOps Skill | Package prompts and patterns |

Each lesson ends with a skill reflection: test, find gaps, and improve.

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with an automated pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys your Kubernetes agent via ArgoCD, plus a GitOps skill for future projects. The flow moves from foundations to ArgoCD production patterns, then AI-assisted authoring, ending in a spec-driven capstone.

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 49-51 (Docker, Kubernetes, Helm)
- Context from Chapters 52-53 (Kafka, Dapr) for services you deploy
