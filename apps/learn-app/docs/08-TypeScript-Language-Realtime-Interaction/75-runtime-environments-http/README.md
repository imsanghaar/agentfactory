# Chapter 75: Runtime Environments & HTTP Communication

Target every environment your AI experiences run on: Node, Deno, Edge, and browser. Build a `cross-runtime-http` skill for clients/servers that work across targets.

---

## Goals

- Understand runtime differences (Node/Deno/Edge/browser)
- Build cross-runtime HTTP clients/servers
- Handle SSE/Web fetch quirks across environments
- Capture patterns in a reusable runtime/HTTP skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Runtime capabilities and compatibility
- Cross-runtime HTTP client/server patterns
- Streaming considerations per environment
- Capstone: cross-runtime HTTP wrapper; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with portable HTTP/streaming utilities and a runtime-aware skill.

---

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 73-74
