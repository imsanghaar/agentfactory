# Chapter 76: Building Type-Safe AI SDKs

Create SDKs with confidence. This chapter builds a `type-safe-sdk` skill to model APIs with Zod, handle streaming, and publish reliable client libraries.

---

## Goals

- Design SDK architecture patterned after major AI providers
- Validate payloads with Zod and enforce contracts
- Support streaming and tool-call flows in SDKs
- Publish SDK packages with quality gates

---

## Lesson Progression

- SDK architecture patterns
- Zod-backed request/response modeling
- Streaming and tool-call support
- Capstone: SDK for the Part 7 FastAPI backend; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a type-safe SDK for your backend plus a reusable SDK-building skill.

---

## Prerequisites

- Chapters 73-75
