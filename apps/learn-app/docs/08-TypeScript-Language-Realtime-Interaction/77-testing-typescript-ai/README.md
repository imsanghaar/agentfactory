# Chapter 77: Testing TypeScript for AI Applications

Test the UI/SDK layer properly. This chapter builds a `ts-testing` skill for unit, integration, streaming, and contract tests on AI interactions.

---

## Goals

- Write unit/integration tests with Vitest/Jest
- Mock AI APIs and streaming responses
- Implement contract tests to keep frontend/backend types in sync
- Use TypeScript’s compiler as a safety net

---

## Lesson Progression

- Testing foundations for TS projects
- Mocking AI/streaming interactions
- Contract testing for shared types
- Capstone: test suite for your SDK/clients; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with a comprehensive test suite and a reusable TS testing skill.
