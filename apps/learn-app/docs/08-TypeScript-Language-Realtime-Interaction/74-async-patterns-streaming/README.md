# Chapter 74: Async Patterns & Streaming

Build async muscle for AI interactions. This chapter creates an `async-streaming` skill to handle Promises, cancellation, SSE, and streaming transports for chat/voice agents.

---

## Goals

- Use Promises/async-await with robust error handling
- Handle streaming via SSE and streamable HTTP transports
- Implement cancellation (AbortController) and retries/timeouts
- Capture patterns in a reusable async/streaming skill

---

## Lesson Progression

- Async foundations and Promise patterns
- Streaming with SSE and HTTP streaming APIs
- Cancellation, retries, and timeouts
- Capstone: streaming client utilities; finalize the skill

---

## Outcome & Method

You finish with reusable streaming utilities and an async/streaming skill ready for later chapters and capstones.

---

## Prerequisites

- Chapter 73 fundamentals
