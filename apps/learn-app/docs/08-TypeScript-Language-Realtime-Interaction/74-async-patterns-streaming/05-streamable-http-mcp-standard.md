# Streamable HTTP: The MCP Standard

In March 2025, the Model Context Protocol team made a significant decision: deprecate the SSE transport that had served MCP since its initial release and replace it with Streamable HTTP. This wasn't a minor version bump—it was a fundamental rethinking of how MCP clients and servers communicate.

If you've been following the AI tooling landscape, you know MCP is becoming the standard for connecting AI models to external capabilities. Understanding this transport evolution isn't just protocol trivia—it's essential knowledge for building production AI systems that interact with MCP servers.

This lesson explains why the change happened, how Streamable HTTP works, and how to implement clients that work with modern MCP infrastructure.

## Why MCP Deprecated SSE

Server-Sent Events worked for MCP's initial use case: streaming responses from server to client. But as MCP adoption grew, three limitations became critical:

### Limitation 1: SSE is Unidirectional

SSE was designed for one thing: pushing data from server to client. That's perfect for streaming AI responses, but MCP needs more. Modern MCP interactions involve:

- Client sends tool request to server
- Server might need to ask client for clarification
- Client provides additional context
- Server completes the operation

This back-and-forth requires bidirectional communication. With pure SSE, MCP had to maintain two separate endpoints:

```
Client ──POST─→ MCP Server (for requests)
Client ←─SSE──  MCP Server (for responses/notifications)
```

Two endpoints means two connections, doubled complexity, and infrastructure that needs to handle both patterns.

### Limitation 2: Infrastructure Compatibility

Many corporate environments use HTTP proxies, load balancers, and firewalls that handle standard HTTP requests without issue but struggle with long-lived SSE connections:

| Infrastructure | HTTP POST | SSE Stream |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Standard proxies | Works | Often times out |
| Load balancers | Distributes normally | Session affinity issues |
| Firewalls | Usually allowed | May block long connections |
| CDNs | Caches appropriately | Cannot cache streams |

When developers reported that their MCP servers worked in development but failed behind corporate infrastructure, the transport was often the culprit.

### Limitation 3: Complexity for Simple Use Cases

Not every MCP interaction needs streaming. A tool that looks up a database value and returns it doesn't benefit from a streaming connection—it just needs request/response. But with SSE, every interaction required establishing a stream, even for simple operations.

Streamable HTTP solves this by making streaming optional:

```typescript
// Simple request/response - no streaming needed
const result = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(request),
});
const data = await result.json();

// Streaming when you need it - still uses the same endpoint
const streamResult = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(request),
});
for await (const chunk of parseSSE(streamResult.body!)) {
  // Handle streamed data
}
```

Same endpoint, same protocol, optional streaming. The server decides whether to stream based on the request.

## How Streamable HTTP Works

Streamable HTTP is elegantly simple: POST your JSON-RPC request to a single endpoint. The server responds with either:

1. **A complete JSON response** (for quick operations)
2. **An SSE stream** (for long-running or multi-message responses)

The client doesn't need to know in advance which will happen—it handles whatever comes back.

### The Request Pattern

Every MCP request follows JSON-RPC 2.0 format:

```typescript
interface McpRequest {
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string;
  method: string;
  params?: unknown;
}
```

You POST this to the MCP endpoint:

```typescript
const response = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    method: "tools/call",
    params: {
      name: "search_database",
      arguments: { query: "customer records" },
    },
  }),
});
```

### Session Management with Mcp-Session-Id

Stateful MCP operations require session continuity. The server assigns a session ID in its first response; the client includes it in subsequent requests:

```typescript
// First request - no session yet
const firstResponse = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(initRequest),
});

// Server assigns session ID in response header
const sessionId = firstResponse.headers.get("Mcp-Session-Id");

// Subsequent requests include the session ID
const secondResponse = await fetch(mcpEndpoint, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Mcp-Session-Id": sessionId!,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(nextRequest),
});
```

This pattern enables stateful conversations without the complexity of maintaining WebSocket connections.

## Implementing a Streamable HTTP Client

Here's a complete implementation that handles both simple responses and streamed responses:

```typescript
interface McpResponse {
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string;
  result?: unknown;
  error?: { code: number; message: string };
}

class McpClient {
  private endpoint: string;
  private sessionId: string | null = null;

  constructor(endpoint: string) {
    this.endpoint = endpoint;
  }

  async request(method: string, params?: unknown): Promise<McpResponse> {
    const headers: Record<string, string> = {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    };

    // Include session ID if we have one
    if (this.sessionId) {
      headers["Mcp-Session-Id"] = this.sessionId;
    }

    const response = await fetch(this.endpoint, {
      method: "POST",
      headers,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        id: crypto.randomUUID(),
        method,
        params,
      }),
    });

    // Update session ID from response
    const newSessionId = response.headers.get("Mcp-Session-Id");
    if (newSessionId) {
      this.sessionId = newSessionId;
    }

    // Check if response is SSE stream or regular JSON
    const contentType = response.headers.get("Content-Type") ?? "";

    if (contentType.includes("text/event-stream")) {
      // Handle as SSE stream - collect final result
      return await this.handleStreamedResponse(response);
    } else {
      // Handle as regular JSON response
      return await response.json();
    }
  }

  private async handleStreamedResponse(
    response: Response
  ): Promise<McpResponse> {
    const reader = response.body!.getReader();
    const decoder = new TextDecoder();
    let buffer = "";
    let finalResult: McpResponse | null = null;

    while (true) {
      const { done, value } = await reader.read();
      if (done) break;

      buffer += decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
      const lines = buffer.split("\n\n");
      buffer = lines.pop() ?? "";

      for (const line of lines) {
        if (line.startsWith("data: ") && line !== "data: [DONE]") {
          const data = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));
          // Accumulate or process intermediate results
          finalResult = data;
        }
      }
    }

    if (!finalResult) {
      throw new Error("No result received from stream");
    }
    return finalResult;
  }

  async initialize(): Promise<void> {
    const result = await this.request("initialize", {
      protocolVersion: "2025-03-26",
      capabilities: {},
      clientInfo: {
        name: "my-mcp-client",
        version: "1.0.0",
      },
    });

    if (result.error) {
      throw new Error(`Initialize failed: ${result.error.message}`);
    }
  }

  async callTool(name: string, args: unknown): Promise<unknown> {
    const result = await this.request("tools/call", {
      name,
      arguments: args,
    });

    if (result.error) {
      throw new Error(`Tool call failed: ${result.error.message}`);
    }

    return result.result;
  }
}
```

**Output (using the client):**

```typescript
const client = new McpClient("https://mcp.example.com/v1");
await client.initialize();
const result = await client.callTool("search", { query: "TypeScript" });
console.log(result);
// { documents: [...], count: 42 }
```

## SSE vs Streamable HTTP: Complete Comparison

| Dimension | SSE | Streamable HTTP |
|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| **Direction** | Server to Client only | Bidirectional over HTTP |
| **Endpoints** | Separate POST + SSE endpoints | Single unified endpoint |
| **Connection** | Long-lived stream | Request/response (stream optional) |
| **Infrastructure** | Problematic with proxies | Standard HTTP compatibility |
| **Statefulness** | Connection-based state | Header-based session (Mcp-Session-Id) |
| **Simple operations** | Still requires stream setup | Plain HTTP response |
| **Complex operations** | Natural fit | SSE streaming still available |
| **MCP Status** | Deprecated (2024-11-05) | Current standard (2025-03-26) |

## Backward Compatibility Detection

Not all MCP servers have upgraded to Streamable HTTP. When connecting to an unknown server, use this detection pattern:

```typescript
async function detectTransport(
  serverUrl: string
): Promise<"streamable-http" | "sse"> {
  try {
    // Try Streamable HTTP first
    const response = await fetch(serverUrl, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        jsonrpc: "2.0",
        id: "probe",
        method: "initialize",
        params: {
          protocolVersion: "2025-03-26",
          capabilities: {},
          clientInfo: { name: "probe", version: "1.0" },
        },
      }),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      return "streamable-http";
    }
  } catch {
    // POST failed, try SSE
  }

  // Fall back to SSE detection
  return "sse";
}
```

This follows the MCP specification recommendation: attempt POST first, fall back to SSE for servers using the older protocol version.

## When to Use Each Transport

**Use Streamable HTTP (current standard) when:**

- Building new MCP clients or servers
- Deploying behind corporate infrastructure
- You need bidirectional communication
- Simple operations don't require streaming

**Support SSE fallback when:**

- Connecting to servers you don't control
- Supporting legacy MCP server versions
- Maximum compatibility is required

The MCP TypeScript SDK 1.10.0 (released April 17, 2025) was the first to support Streamable HTTP. If you're using an older SDK version, you'll need to upgrade.

### Prompt 1: Explore the Design Decision

```text
I'm learning about MCP's switch from SSE to Streamable HTTP. The lesson
explains infrastructure compatibility was a major reason. Help me
understand this more concretely:

1. What specific proxy/firewall behaviors break SSE connections?
2. Why do load balancers struggle with long-lived connections?
3. How does Streamable HTTP avoid these issues while still supporting
   streaming when needed?

Challenge my understanding—ask me to explain back what I learned.
```

**What you're learning:** Deep understanding of infrastructure constraints that drove protocol evolution. This connects TypeScript async patterns to real deployment challenges.

### Prompt 2: Implement Session State Tracking

```text
I've implemented a basic MCP client with session management using
Mcp-Session-Id headers. Now I want to add resilience:

1. What happens if the server restarts and our session ID becomes invalid?
2. How should we detect session expiration?
3. What's the reconnection strategy?

Walk me through implementing session recovery. Ask me questions about
my use case to tailor the solution.
```

**What you're learning:** Production-ready session management patterns that handle real-world failure scenarios—not just the happy path.

### Prompt 3: Connect to Your Domain

```text
I work with [describe your domain: chatbots / data pipelines / dev tools /
enterprise systems]. MCP lets AI models connect to external tools
via Streamable HTTP.

Help me think through:
1. What tools in my domain would benefit from MCP integration?
2. Would my infrastructure handle Streamable HTTP or do I have proxy
   concerns?
3. What would a minimal MCP server look like for one of my tools?

Ask me clarifying questions about my specific environment.
```

**What you're learning:** Practical application of protocol knowledge to your specific context—transforming abstract concepts into actionable architecture decisions.

### Safety Note

When implementing MCP clients that connect to external servers, validate server certificates, handle authentication properly, and never expose session IDs in logs. MCP servers can execute arbitrary tools—only connect to servers you trust.
