# Part 8: TypeScript — The Language of Realtime and Interaction

Parts 5-7 gave you Python backends, agent frameworks, and cloud deployment. Part 9 teaches the language of the user-facing layer: TypeScript. You'll build interactive, realtime experiences that connect users to the intelligence you've already shipped.

---

## Goals

By completing Part 9, you will:

- **Write modern TypeScript** with generics, unions, and type narrowing
- **Handle async and streaming** patterns for chat, voice, and agent tool calls
- **Target multiple runtimes** (Node, Deno, Edge, browser) with shared tooling
- **Build and consume APIs** using HTTP, SSE, and WebSockets
- **Ship type-safe SDKs** with validation and contract testing
- **Deliver great DX** through tested CLIs and developer tools

---

## Chapter Progression

Six chapters map to the frontend skills AI engineers need:

- **Fundamentals (73)**: Type system, syntax, tooling, and project setup.
- **Async & Streaming (74)**: Promises, cancellation, SSE, and streaming transport patterns.
- **Runtimes & HTTP (75)**: Node/Deno/Edge/browser targets plus cross-runtime HTTP clients and servers.
- **Type-Safe SDKs (76)**: Zod-backed SDK patterns used by major AI providers.
- **Testing (77)**: Unit, integration, and contract testing for AI interactions.
- **CLI & Developer Experience (78)**: Publishable CLIs with streaming output and professional UX.

**Why this order?** You master the language first, then async patterns, then runtimes and networking, then SDK architecture, testing, and finally polished tooling.

## Outcome & Method

You finish Part 9 able to build type-safe clients and interfaces for your AI backends, complete with streaming UX and robust tests. The teaching approach mirrors earlier parts: fundamentals → AI-assisted implementation → reusable utilities → spec-driven capstone work.
