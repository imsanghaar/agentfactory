In the AI era, the most valuable companies won't sell software—they'll manufacture <em>AI employees</em>: role-based systems that compose tools, spawn specialist agents, and deliver outcomes at scale.

The SaaS era sold subscriptions; the Agent Factory era sells results. Buyers define intent. Agents execute. Humans supervise and verify. This model industrializes execution through machine-readable specs, reusable skills, Standard Tool Protocols (MCP: a shared tool-connection standard), and cloud-native infrastructure—shifting the focus from manual workflows to <strong>capability on demand</strong>.

What remains: Intent. Verification. Outcome.

### The Paradigm Shift

| Feature             | The SaaS Era (Tools)       | The Agent Factory Era (Labor)              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Product**         | Software Tools             | AI Employees                               |
| **Value Metric**    | Per-Seat Subscriptions     | Per-Outcome Results                        |
| **Execution Model** | Manual & Visible           | Automated & Industrialized                 |
| **Human Role**      | Operator                   | Supervisor & Verifier                      |
| **Integration**     | Rigid, point-to-point APIs | Standard Tool Protocols (MCP)              |
| **Focus**           | How the work is done       | _That_ the work is done—verifiably correct |

### The Industrialized Stack

- **Intent:** The high-level blueprint—goals, constraints, budgets, and permissions.
- **The Factory:** A self-correcting engine where _machine-readable specs_ act as the DNA for agents, connecting reusable skills through _MCP tool contracts_.
- **Outcome:** High-fidelity actions and artifacts—delivered on demand, verified for accuracy, and continuously improved through feedback loops.

Winners in this era will be measured not by seats sold, but by outcomes guaranteed—and the problems they solve.
