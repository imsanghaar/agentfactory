# Chapter 11 Suggestion: Your First AI Employee

**Status**: PROPOSAL FOR REVIEW
**Date**: 2026-02-05

---

## Proposed Structure

```
CHAPTER 11: YOUR FIRST AI EMPLOYEE

L01: The AI Employee Revolution (NEW)
├── OpenClaw story (165k stars, proved the concept)
├── Anthropic Cowork plugins ($830B disruption)
├── Market context: AI Employees are mainstream
└── What you'll build in this chapter

L02: Setup Your AI Employee
├── OpenClaw installation (15-30 min)
├── Ollama for free local LLM (optional)
├── Telegram or CLI connection
└── OUTCOME: Working AI Employee

L03: Your First AI Employee Moment
├── Do REAL valuable work
├── Email triage / Research / Your domain
├── Experience the value firsthand
└── OUTCOME: Proven AI Employee doing useful work

[DECISION POINT]
└── After L03, decide what comes next:
    └── Existing lessons from current Chapter 11?
    └── New plugin pack content?
    └── Platform portability content?
```

## Key Changes from Current Chapter 11

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| L00: Full spec (30 min read) | L01: Quick intro + context (10 min) |
| L01-L07: Build from scratch | L02-L03: Setup + experience first |
| No OpenClaw mention | OpenClaw as the validated proof |
| Value at lesson 7 | **Value at lesson 3** |

---

## What Happens to Existing Lessons?

**Decision deferred until after L03 is drafted.**

Current lessons (L01-L13) remain in place. After students experience OpenClaw:
- Decide which existing lessons become "Part B"
- Decide what needs reframing vs rewriting
- Decide if platform-specific content (watchers, HITL) moves elsewhere

---

## Why This Works

1. **Experience first** — Students have working AI Employee in 1-2 hours
2. **No redundancy** — L01 is new context (OpenClaw + market), not Part 1 repeat
3. **Real value** — L03 has students DO work, not just configure
4. **Flexible continuation** — Existing content can plug in after L03

---

## Timeline Estimate

| Lesson | Effort | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| L01 | 2-3 hours | New content, draw from research |
| L02 | 1-2 hours | Adapt from `06-setup-time-reality.md` |
| L03 | 2-3 hours | Design valuable work exercise |
| **Total** | ~8 hours | Before deciding next steps |

## Open Questions for Review

1. What "valuable work" should L03 demonstrate? (Email? Research? Domain-specific?)
2. Should OpenClaw setup use Telegram, CLI, or both?
3. How much of current Chapter 11 content fits after L03?
4. Do we need a "portability" lesson showing skills work elsewhere?
