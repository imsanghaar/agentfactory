# OpenClaw Research: Final Decision

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Status**: DECISION MADE
**Next Step**: Create new Chapter 11 spec

---

## Decision Summary

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Include OpenClaw in curriculum? | **Yes** - as historical validation, not as platform |
| Current Chapter 11 content? | **Archive** - decide after new chapter takes shape |
| New Chapter 11 focus? | **Portable Plugin Packs** - work with any agent platform |
| OpenClaw's role? | **15-30 min "proof of concept"** - shows, validates, exits |

## The Strategic Insight

**User's airplane analogy**:
> "You're saying here's an airplane but you can't fly it, let me teach you to rebuild 6 planes that each go one place."

**Correct model**:
> "Here's what an airplane looks like (OpenClaw). Now build portable engines (skills) that work in ANY airplane."

## Market Context

- **January 2026**: OpenClaw goes viral (165k stars, fastest-growing GitHub repo)
- **February 2026**: Anthropic launches Claude Cowork plugins
- **Result**: $830B software stock selloff - "AI Employee" is mainstream

The market has validated AI Employees. We teach portable skills.

## New Chapter 11 Direction

### Title: "Your First AI Employee"

### Part A: The AI Employee Moment (2 lessons - NEW)
```
L01: The AI Employee Revolution
├── OpenClaw story (165k stars proved the concept)
├── Anthropic Cowork plugins (the industry response)
├── Demo/video of AI Employee in action
└── Key insight: We build PORTABLE skills

L02: Portable Skills Architecture
├── Skills work with Claude Code, Cowork, OpenClaw, anything
├── MCP is the universal connector
└── Your skills = your permanent assets
```

### Part B: Email Plugin Pack (adapted from current Bronze tier)
```
L03-L08: Build portable email skills
├── Email drafter, templates, summarizer (current L02-L04)
├── Specialist subagents (current L05)
├── Gmail MCP integration (current L06)
└── Complete plugin pack (current L07 reframed)
```

### Part C: Test Everywhere (NEW)
```
L09: Verify Portability
├── Test with Claude Code (what students know)
├── Test with Claude Cowork (if available)
└── (Optional) Test with OpenClaw
```

## What Happens to Current Chapter 11

| Content | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Current Chapter 11 folder | **Keep as-is** for now |
| L02-L06 (Skills content) | Will be adapted into new chapter |
| L08-L12 (Platform content) | Decision deferred - may become Chapter 12 or optional |
| L00 (Spec) | Will be rewritten for new direction |

**Approach**: Build new chapter, then decide what to migrate/archive.

## Key Principles Established

1. **OpenClaw validates, doesn't define** - It proved AI Employees work. We don't build on it.

2. **Portable > Platform-specific** - Skills that work everywhere beat skills locked to one platform.

3. **MCP is universal** - The connector layer works across all compliant agents.

4. **Experience first, understand second** - Students see OpenClaw demo, then build their own portable version.

5. **Market-aligned** - $830B selloff shows AI Employees are mainstream. We're teaching the right thing.
