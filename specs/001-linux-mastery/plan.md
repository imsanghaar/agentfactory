## I. Chapter Analysis

### Chapter Type

**Technical/Code-Focused Chapter** — This chapter teaches practical Linux command-line skills required for deploying, managing, and monitoring AI agents (Digital FTEs). All concepts require hands-on CLI practice with realistic agent deployment scenarios.

**Recognition signals**:
- Focus on building skills/implementation (apply/create)
- Learning objectives use "apply/create/implement" verbs
- Code examples required (bash scripts, systemd files, commands)
- Progressive complexity from basic to advanced

**Structure**: Sequential lessons (9 lessons justified by concept density), using descriptive titles tied to agent lifecycle management.

### Concept Density Analysis

**Core Concepts** (from spec): 12 major concepts

1. CLI architect mindset and terminal fundamentals
2. Modern navigation tools (zoxide, fzf)
3. Package management (apt)
4. Shell customization (.bashrc/.zshrc)
5. tmux session management (persistent sessions, panes)
6. Bash scripting automation (variables, loops, functions)
7. Text processing (grep, sed, awk, pipes)
8. Security hardening (users, permissions, SSH)
9. Environment variables and secret management
10. Process monitoring (htop/btop, ps, kill)
11. systemd service deployment (.service files, restart policies)
12. Debugging and troubleshooting (logs, networking, disk)

**Complexity Assessment**: Standard-to-Complex (B1-B2 proficiency)

**Justified Lesson Count**: 9 lessons

- **Foundation (Lessons 1-2)**: Terminal mindset, environment setup (Layer 1)
- **Application (Lessons 3-5)**: tmux, scripting, security (Layer 2)
- **Integration (Lesson 6)**: Process control with systemd (Layer 2→3 transition)
- **Advanced (Lesson 7)**: Debugging and troubleshooting skills (Layer 2)
- **Mastery (Lesson 8)**: Comprehensive deployment workflow (Layer 3)
- **Capstone (Lesson 9)**: Production Digital FTE deployment (Layer 4)

**Reasoning**: 12 core concepts across 6 major topic areas (Terminal, tmux, Scripting, Security, systemd, Debugging) justify 9 lessons. This is NOT an arbitrary template—the lesson count emerges from concept density + B1-B2 proficiency requirements + progressive complexity through agent lifecycle.

**Proficiency Progression**: B1 (Lessons 1-6) → B2 (Lessons 7-9)

## VI. Teaching Modality Selection with Rationale

### Modality Distribution Across Chapter

| Lesson | Modality | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Direct Teaching | Foundational concepts require clear explanation before practice |
| 2 | Hands-On Discovery | Tool installation best learned through experimentation |
| 3 | Collaborative Discovery | tmux workflows benefit from AI suggesting patterns |
| 4 | Collaborative Debugging | Scripting errors common; AI accelerates learning |
| 5 | Error Analysis | Security mistakes teach valuable lessons through controlled failure |
| 6 | Hands-On Discovery → Intelligence Design | systemd requires practice, then pattern crystallization |
| 7 | Error Analysis | Debugging skills learned through diagnosing real failures |
| 8 | Specification-First | Intelligence design requires structured thinking |
| 9 | Specification-First | Capstone requires systematic planning |

### Anti-Convergence Validation

**Previous chapter (Chapter 9)**: Version Control with Git
- Likely used: Direct Teaching + Hands-On Discovery

**This chapter (Chapter 10)**: Linux Mastery
- Using: Direct Teaching (Lesson 1) + Hands-On Discovery (Lessons 2, 3, 6) + Collaborative Debugging (Lesson 4) + Error Analysis (Lessons 5, 7) + Specification-First (Lessons 8, 9)

- [x] Skills created are reusable across future chapters
- [x] Capstone produces sellable Digital FTE (deployed production agent)
- [x] Specification-first methodology taught in Lesson 9
- [x] Anti-convergence achieved (multiple modalities, not just direct teaching)

## XI. Implementation Notes

### Safety Requirements (Constitutional Mandate)

**All dangerous operations include explicit warnings**:
- ⚠️ sudo commands: Explain root privilege risks
- ⚠️ rm -rf: Show safer alternatives, warn about data loss
- ⚠️ chmod 777: Explain security risks, recommend specific permissions
- ⚠️ kill -9: Explain SIGKILL risks, recommend SIGTERM first
- ⚠️ SSH password disable: Require backup session, test key auth first

### Real-World Scenario Integration

**Every command/example uses agent deployment context**:
- File navigation → Finding agent configs in /etc/agents
- Package installation → Installing Python for FastAPI agents
- tmux sessions → Monitoring long-running agent training
- Bash scripts → Automating agent deployment
- Security → Locking down agent server
- systemd → Running agent as production service
- Logs → Diagnosing agent failures

**No generic "hello world" examples** — all tied to agent lifecycle.

### Progressive Complexity

**Within each topic**:
- Basic → Advanced progression
- Simple examples → Production patterns
- Manual practice → AI collaboration → Reusable intelligence

**Across chapter**:
- Foundation (Lessons 1-2) → Application (Lessons 3-5) → Integration (Lessons 6-7) → Mastery (Lessons 8-9)

## XII. Success Metrics

**This chapter succeeds when**:

- ✅ Lesson count justified by concept density (9 lessons for 12 concepts across 6 topics)
- ✅ Stage progression enforced (1→2→3→4 without skipping)
- ✅ Cognitive load respects CEFR limits per lesson (all within B1-B2 limits)
- ✅ Three Roles explicitly planned in all Layer 2 lessons (Lessons 3-7)
- ✅ Spec-first ONLY in Layer 4 (Lesson 9), not earlier
- ✅ All skill dependencies satisfied (linear progression)
- ✅ All evals covered (SC-001 through SC-010)
- ✅ Two reusable skills created (deployment-automation, linux-agent-ops)
- ✅ Capstone produces production Digital FTE
- ✅ Safety warnings included for all dangerous operations
- ✅ All examples use realistic agent deployment scenarios

**Failure modes to avoid**:

- ❌ Arbitrary lesson count (template-based) — Prevented by concept density analysis
- ❌ Skipped stages (AI in Lesson 1) — Prevented by stage progression framework
- ❌ Cognitive overload (B2 lesson with 15 concepts) — Prevented by concept counting
- ❌ Missing Three Roles (one-way instruction) — Prevented by explicit planning
- ❌ Skill dependencies violated — Prevented by dependency graph validation
- ❌ Generic examples (todo apps) — Prevented by agent-scenario requirement
- ❌ Missing safety warnings — Prevented by constitutional requirement
