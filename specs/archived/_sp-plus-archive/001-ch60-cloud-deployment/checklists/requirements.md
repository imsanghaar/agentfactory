# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 60 - Real Cloud Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-30

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Educational Content Checks

- [x] Assumed Knowledge section included
- [x] Proficiency level specified (B1)
- [x] Layer progression documented (L1 → L2 → L3 → L4)
- [x] Skill-First pattern applied (L00 first)
