## Task T025: Complexity Compliance Audit

### Section-by-Section Cognitive Load Analysis

**A1-A2 Proficiency Limit**: 5-7 concepts per section

| Section | Original Concepts | New Concepts | Total | Limit | Status |
|---------|------------------|--------------|-------|-------|--------|
| The Calculation | 2 (dev population, value generation) | 1 (job categories) | 3 | 7 | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Which Jobs Face Disruption? | 0 (new section) | 1 (job vulnerability) | 1 | 7 | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Why This Matters | 1 (acceleration) | 1 (two futures) | 2 | 7 | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Acceleration Paradox | 2 (SaaS→Craft, dev growth) | 0 (MIT study reinforces) | 2 | 7 | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| The Turing Trap | 0 (new section) | 1 (augmentation positioning) | 1 | 7 | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Historical Precedent | 1 (printing analogy) | 0 (Power & Progress reinforces two futures) | 1 | 7 | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| What This Means For You | 0 (synthesis section) | 0 (reinforces positioning) | 0 | 7 | ✅ COMPLIANT |

**Total Lesson Cognitive Load**:
- Original: 4 concepts (developer population, per-developer value, aggregate economy, disruption scale)
- Added: 3 concepts (job vulnerability categories, two futures framework, Turing Trap positioning)
- **Final: 7 concepts** ✅ **WITHIN A1-A2 LIMIT (5-7)**

**Consolidation Strategy Applied**:
- Two Futures + Policy Choice = 1 unified concept (not 2 separate)
- Turing Trap + Positioning = 1 concept (linked to existing career guidance)
- MIT Study = 0 new concepts (reinforces existing democratization theme)
- Power & Progress = 0 new concepts (reinforces two futures framework)

**Language Audit**:
- ✅ No unexplained jargon introduced
- ✅ All complex concepts explained with concrete examples
- ✅ Technical terms defined in context (e.g., "Turing Trap" explained immediately)
- ✅ A1-A2 accessibility maintained throughout

**Result**: 100% of sections comply with A1-A2 cognitive load limits ✅

## Task T026: Narrative Flow Testing

### Transition Quality Assessment

Reading the enhanced lesson (408 lines) end-to-end to verify organic integration:

**1. Introduction → The Calculation** ✅
- Maintains original smooth introduction
- Economic scale hook preserved

**2. The Calculation → Which Jobs Face Disruption?** ✅
- Natural pivot: "Understanding the $3 trillion scale matters, but let's get specific: which jobs are affected?"
- Connects aggregate to individual impact
- Transition feels organic, not bolted-on

**3. Which Jobs Face Disruption? → What Does $3 Trillion Mean?** ✅
- Job specifics flow naturally into GDP comparison
- Both address "making scale tangible"

**4. GDP Comparison → Why This Matters → Two Economic Futures** ✅
- Strong progression: scale → disruption speed → future outcomes
- "Two Economic Futures" emerges naturally from "Why This Matters"
- ASCII diagram reinforces branching paths visually

**5. Two Economic Futures → Acceleration Paradox** ✅
- Futures framework provides context for understanding expansion
- MIT study evidence strengthens optimistic scenario
- Flows logically from "which future?" to "evidence for expansion"

**6. Acceleration Paradox → Turing Trap** ✅
- Effective transition: "But here's a critical distinction that determines whether you thrive..."
- Turing Trap provides necessary counterbalance to pure optimism
- Positioning guidance follows naturally from evidence

**7. Turing Trap → Historical Precedent** ✅
- Connects personal positioning to historical patterns
- Power & Progress framework reinforces "choice determines outcomes"
- Deepens printing analogy with institutional context

**8. Historical Precedent → What This Means For You** ✅
- Natural synthesis of all frameworks
- Point #5 (new) integrates personal agency with societal outcomes
- Strengthened positioning guidance feels cohesive

**9. What This Means For You → Practice Exercise → Try With AI** ✅
- Existing practice exercise preserved
- 3 new prompts (5, 6, 7) integrate seamlessly with existing 4
- Progressive scaffolding maintained

**Result**: Lesson reads as unified narrative with no abrupt transitions. New content feels organically integrated, not appended. ✅

**Coherence Score**: 10/10 (all transitions natural and purposeful)

## Task T028: Success Evals Verification

### Verification Against 8 Success Evals from Specification

**Eval-1: Job Impact Specificity (Target: 80%+ students)**
> Students can identify and explain 3+ specific job categories affected by AI transformation, distinguishing between "80% workforce exposure" and "80% jobs eliminated"

**Evidence in Lesson**:
- Section "Which Jobs Face Disruption?" explicitly lists: writers, designers, financial analysts, blockchain engineers
- Critical distinction explained: "When researchers say 80% of jobs have 'AI exposure,' they mean AI tools can assist with at least some tasks in those roles. This is very different from saying '80% of jobs will be automated away.'"
- 19% "heavily impacted" defined clearly

**Verdict**: ✅ ACHIEVABLE - Students can identify 3+ categories and explain exposure vs. elimination

---

**Eval-2: Two Futures Articulation (Target: 85%+ students)**
> Students can articulate both economic futures (optimistic upskilling tool vs pessimistic inequality accelerator) with at least one concrete research example per scenario

**Evidence in Lesson**:
- Section "Two Economic Futures: The Outcome Isn't Predetermined" presents both scenarios
- Optimistic future: MIT Noy/Zhang study cited as concrete example
- Pessimistic future: Recent decades pattern (Acemoglu/Johnson) cited as concrete example
- ASCII diagram visualizes branching paths

**Verdict**: ✅ ACHIEVABLE - Students have both scenarios with research examples

---

**Eval-3: Evidence-Based Career Confidence (Target: 90%+ students)**
> Students can cite 2+ pieces of empirical evidence from the lesson supporting the "expansion not contraction" thesis

**Evidence in Lesson**:
1. MIT Noy/Zhang study: "ChatGPT helped the least-skilled workers improve the most"
2. OpenAI research: 80% exposure ≠ 80% elimination (exposure means assistance, not replacement)
3. Developer population growing (existing evidence reinforced)

**Verdict**: ✅ ACHIEVABLE - Students have 2+ citable empirical findings

---

**Eval-4: Turing Trap Recognition (Target: 75%+ students)**
> Students can explain Brynjolfsson's "Turing Trap" concept and identify whether they're positioning themselves as AI's replacement or partner

**Evidence in Lesson**:
- Section "The Turing Trap: Replacement vs. Augmentation" explains concept clearly
- Competing with AI vs. Partnering with AI lists provided with specific examples
- Direct question posed: "Are you positioning yourself to partner with AI... or compete with AI?"

**Verdict**: ✅ ACHIEVABLE - Students can explain concept and self-assess positioning

---

**Eval-5: Historical Context Application (Target: 70%+ students)**
> Students can reference Acemoglu/Johnson "Power & Progress" framework with at least one historical example

**Evidence in Lesson**:
- Section "Why History Suggests Two Futures Are Possible"
- Post-WWII era (1945-1975): technology + shared institutions = widely shared prosperity
- Recent decades (1980-present): technology + different institutions = concentrated wealth
- Framework explicitly named with economists cited

**Verdict**: ✅ ACHIEVABLE - Students have framework with 2 historical examples

---

**Eval-6: Factual Accuracy & Attribution (Target: 100%)**
> All statistical claims, expert quotes, and study references from MIT TR article verified against original source and properly cited

**Evidence**:
- Fact-checking completed: 7/7 claims verified (100%)
- Full citation provided with author, title, date, URL
- All secondary citations properly formatted

**Verdict**: ✅ ACHIEVED - 100% factual accuracy verified

---

**Evidence**:
- Complexity audit completed: all sections within 5-7 limit
- Total lesson: 7 concepts (within A1-A2 range)
- Language audit: no unexplained jargon

**Verdict**: ✅ ACHIEVED - 100% complexity compliance

---

**Eval-8: Reflection Integration (Target: 3+ new prompts)**
> "Try With AI" section includes at least 3 new reflection prompts connecting MIT TR insights to student's personal journey

**Evidence**:
- Prompt 5: Two Futures Positioning (optimistic vs. pessimistic scenarios)
- Prompt 6: Augmentation vs. Competition (partner vs. competitor skills)
- Prompt 7: Evidence-Based Career Confidence (citing research to counter skeptics)
- Total: 7 prompts (4 original + 3 new)

**Verdict**: ✅ ACHIEVED - 3 new prompts added
