# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 55 - Observability & Cost Engineering

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Educational Content Quality

- [x] Chapter teaches AI-native thinking, not just tool mechanics
- [x] L1 lessons build vocabulary/mental models (not just syntax)
- [x] Assumed Knowledge section defines prerequisites
- [x] DACA source mapping identifies source materials per lesson
- [x] Skill-First pattern defines student skill and progression
- [x] Every lesson has defined Layer (L1/L2/L3/L4)
- [x] Proficiency level (B1) documented

## Notes

- All items pass validation
- Specification is ready for `/sp.clarify` and `/sp.plan`
- Chapter covers comprehensive observability stack with clear lesson progression
- DACA source materials are mapped to specific lessons
- Skill-first pattern implemented with `observability-cost-engineer` student skill
