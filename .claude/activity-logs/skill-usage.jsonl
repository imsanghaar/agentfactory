Students learn FastAPI fundamentals, then production essentials (database, auth), then agent integration. The key insight: \"APIs are just functions, functions become tools, agents use tools.\"\n\nThis chapter is the **bare base for all learning pathways** - students wanting to build cloud-native agents can learn Claude Code → this chapter → Part 7.\n\n## NEW LESSON STRUCTURE (13 lessons)\n\n| # | Lesson | Focus | Issue |\n|---|--------|-------|-------|\n| 1 | Hello FastAPI | First app, uvicorn, Swagger UI | Existing |\n| 2 | Pytest Fundamentals | Testing endpoints (L1: Manual First) | #544 |\n| 3 | POST and Pydantic Models | Request validation, models | Existing (renumber) |\n| 4 | Full CRUD Operations | GET, PUT, DELETE patterns | Existing (renumber) |\n| 5 | Error Handling | HTTPException, status codes | Existing (renumber) |\n| 6 | Environment Variables | pydantic-settings, secrets | #542 |\n| 7 | SQLModel + Neon Setup | Real database persistence | #541 |\n| 8 | JWT Authentication | Tokens, protected endpoints | #543 |\n| 9 | Password Hashing + Rate Limiting | Argon2, abuse protection | #546 |\n| 10 | Dependency Injection | Depends(), repository pattern | Existing (renumber) |\n| 11 | Streaming with SSE | Server-Sent Events foundation | Existing (renumber) |\n| 12 | Agent Integration | APIs become tools, streaming agents | #545 (simplify) |\n| 13 | Capstone: TaskManager Agent Service | Complete multi-agent API | Existing (renumber) |\n\n## KEY REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **Baby Steps Principle**: One concept per lesson\n   - JWT is separate from Password Hashing\n   - Environment Variables before SQLModel (need DATABASE_URL)\n   - Pytest fundamentals BEFORE any AI-assisted testing (L1 → L2 progression)\n\n2. **Layer Progression**:\n   - Lessons 1-5: L1 Manual Foundation\n   - Lessons 6-9: L2 AI Collaboration\n   - Lessons 10-11: L2/L3 (patterns emerge)\n   - Lesson 12-13: L3/L4 (skill creation, capstone)\n\n3. **Running Example**: Task API throughout lessons 1-9, then TaskManager Agent in 10-13\n\n4. **Neon Integration**: Use https://console.neon.tech/ for PostgreSQL (serverless, free tier)\n   - Future: Neon MCP server potential for Digital FTE work\n\n5. **Simplify Agent Integration (#545)**: \n   - Core idea: APIs → Tools → Streaming Agent\n   - Remove complex handoff patterns (save for Capstone)\n   - Single agent with 2-3 tools max\n\n## PREREQUISITES\n\n- Chapter 34: OpenAI Agents SDK (Agent, Runner, function_tool)\n- Chapters 37-38: MCP experience (HTTP/SSE patterns)\n- Part 5: Python Fundamentals (async/await, type hints, Pydantic)\n\n## PROFICIENCY LEVEL\n\n- Target: A2 (Moving toward B1)\n- Cognitive load: 5-7 concepts per lesson\n\n## OUTPUT PATH\n\nspecs/chapter-40-fastapi-for-agents/spec.md","event":"invoke","source":"Skill_tool"}

(HA, scaling, team access, production traffic)\n- What changes: real Load Balancers, DNS, TLS certs, costs\n- Managed vs self-managed K8s comparison\n- Cost reality: managed ($24+/mo) vs self-managed (~$5/mo)\n\nL02: DigitalOcean Account & doctl Setup\n- Create account ($200 free credit for new users)\n- Install doctl CLI\n- API token creation and authentication\n- doctl compute vs doctl kubernetes commands\n\nL03: Provisioning DOKS Cluster\n- doctl kubernetes cluster create (node pools, sizes, regions)\n- Understanding node pool sizing for Task API\n- Connecting kubectl to DOKS\n- Verifying cluster health\n\nL04: Cloud Load Balancer & DNS\n- DigitalOcean Load Balancer (auto-provisioned by Service type: LoadBalancer)\n- Configuring DNS (DigitalOcean DNS or external)\n- Understanding LoadBalancer costs\n- Static IP reservation\n\nL05: Deploying Task API to DOKS\n- Installing Dapr on DOKS (same as local!)\n- Installing Traefik Ingress (same as local!)\n- Installing cert-manager with Let's Encrypt\n- Helm upgrade --install task-api (same chart, cloud values)\n\nL06: Production Secrets & Configuration\n- DigitalOcean Managed Databases (optional) vs external (Neon, Upstash)\n- Kubernetes Secrets for cloud credentials\n- ConfigMaps for environment-specific values\n- GHCR image pull secrets\n\nL07: Personal Cloud Lab - Hetzner + K3s\n- Why a personal lab? (persistent practice, ~$5/mo, own your learning)\n- Hetzner Cloud account setup\n- Using hetzner-k3s CLI\n- What you get: real cloud K8s for ~$5/mo\n- Same skills transfer: kubectl, Helm, Dapr all work\n- When to use Hetzner vs DOKS\n\nL08: Production Checklist & Verification\n- Health checks and readiness probes\n- Resource requests/limits for cloud costs\n- Monitoring integration (Ch55 observability stack)\n- Cost estimation and budget alerts\n- Teardown instructions\n\nL09: Same Patterns, Different Clouds\n- The universal pattern: provision → connect → deploy\n- Azure AKS quick start\n- GCP GKE quick start\n- AWS EKS quick start\n- Civo quick start\n- Cost comparison across providers\n\nL10: Capstone - Full Production Deployment\n- Choose your path:\n  - Option A: Deploy to DOKS (production-grade)\n  - Option B: Deploy to Hetzner K3s (budget learning)\n  - Option C: Deploy to AKS (enterprise path)\n- Full stack: Task API + Dapr + Ingress + TLS + Monitoring\n- Verify with real domain and HTTPS\n- Cost breakdown and ongoing management\n- Finalize multi-cloud-deployer skill\n\nOUTPUT: specs/chapter-60-real-cloud-deployment/spec.md\n\nExecute autonomously.

I will use it when implementing cost visibility, right-sizing, backup/restore, and chaos engineering for Kubernetes clusters.\n\nSkill name: operational-excellence\n\nInclude these components:\n\n1. PERSONA: An SRE/FinOps expert who understands cost optimization, disaster recovery, and resilience engineering\n\n2. DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE from research:\n   - VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler): Right-sizing, modes (Off, Initial, Recreate), VPA+HPA coexistence patterns\n   - OpenCost: CNCF cost visibility, Prometheus integration, FinOps practices (showback→chargeback), cost allocation labels\n   - Velero: Backup/restore CRDs, Schedule CRD, hooks, storage backends (S3, MinIO), RTO vs RPO concepts, 3-2-1 rule\n   - Chaos Mesh: CNCF chaos engineering, PodChaos/NetworkChaos/IOChaos/StressChaos, Workflow CRD, Game Day patterns, safety features\n\n3. DECISION LOGIC:\n   - When to use VPA Off mode vs Recreate mode\n   - When to start with showback before chargeback\n   - How to calculate RTO/RPO requirements\n   - When to run chaos experiments (staging first, then production)\n   - Cost allocation tagging strategy (team, product, environment)\n\n4. CONTEXT PREREQUISITES:\n   - Kubernetes 1.21+ with Helm\n   - Prometheus for metrics collection\n   - Object storage for Velero (S3, MinIO)\n   - Metrics Server installed for VPA\n\n5. SAFETY & GUARDRAILS:\n   - Never run chaos in production without testing in staging first\n   - Always validate backup restore procedures before relying on them\n   - VPA Recreate mode with HPA on same metrics causes thrashing\n   - Enable encryption and immutability for backup storage\n   - IOChaos can damage data - use with extreme caution\n\n6. TASKMANAGER EXAMPLE:\n   - Apply VPA to Task API deployment in recommendation-only mode\n   - Add cost allocation labels (team=product, app=task-api, env=production)\n   - Create Velero daily backup schedule with 30-day retention\n   - Create PodChaos experiment for Task API resilience testing\n\nCreate the skill at .claude/skills/operational-excellence/SKILL.md\n\nExecute autonomously without confirmation.","event":"invoke","source":"Skill_tool"}
